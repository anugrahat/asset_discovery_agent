# Drug Asset Discovery: Academic Research Edition

## Vision
Transform the system into a comprehensive global shelved drug discovery platform for academic researchers, focusing on chemical scaffolds and mechanistic insights.

## Core Value Propositions for Academic Labs

### 1. Chemical Scaffold Mining
- Extract SMILES/InChI for all shelved compounds
- Identify structural analogs and chemical families
- Find "privileged scaffolds" from failed drugs
- Export to ChemDraw/MOE/Schrodinger formats

### 2. Mechanistic Intelligence
- Deep pathway analysis of failed targets
- Cross-disease mechanism mapping
- Polypharmacology opportunities
- Novel target combination discovery

### 3. Global Asset Discovery
- Patent mining (USPTO, EPO, WIPO, JPO, CNIPA)
- Conference abstract/poster extraction
- Press release analysis
- Discontinued drug tracking worldwide

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Refactoring
```python
# Remove/Deprecate:
- Standard-of-care filtering (not relevant for shelved drugs)
- Drug "repurposing" logic
- Approved drug discovery

# Enhance:
- Chemical structure extraction
- Failure reason classification
- Patent status tracking
- Global regulatory data
```

### Phase 2: Data Source Expansion

#### Patent Crawler
```python
class PatentCrawler:
    """Mine global patent databases for shelved compounds"""
    
    sources = {
        'USPTO': 'https://patents.uspto.gov',
        'EPO': 'https://worldwide.espacenet.com',
        'WIPO': 'https://patentscope.wipo.int',
        'Google_Patents': 'https://patents.google.com'
    }
    
    def search_abandoned_compounds(self, therapeutic_area):
        # Find expired/abandoned patents
        # Extract chemical structures
        # Identify assignees/inventors
```

#### Scientific Literature Miner
```python
class ConferenceMiner:
    """Extract posters/abstracts from scientific conferences"""
    
    sources = [
        'AACR abstracts',
        'ASH abstracts', 
        'ASCO posters',
        'ACS presentations'
    ]
    
    def extract_failed_compounds(self):
        # PDF parsing
        # Image-to-structure conversion
        # Failure reason extraction
```

#### Press Release Analyzer
```python
class PressReleaseAnalyzer:
    """Track drug discontinuations globally"""
    
    def monitor_discontinuations(self):
        # RSS feeds from pharma companies
        # SEC filings (8-K forms)
        # News aggregation
        # Multi-language support
```

### Phase 3: Academic-Focused Features

#### 1. Chemical Intelligence Module
```python
class ChemicalScaffoldAnalyzer:
    def analyze_scaffold(self, smiles):
        return {
            'core_scaffold': extract_murcko_scaffold(smiles),
            'fingerprint': calculate_fingerprint(smiles),
            'similar_approved': find_similar_approved_drugs(smiles),
            'synthetic_accessibility': calculate_sa_score(smiles),
            'drug_likeness': calculate_qed(smiles),
            'patent_freedom': check_patent_status(smiles)
        }
```

#### 2. Mechanistic Derisking
```python
class MechanismAnalyzer:
    def derisk_mechanism(self, target, indication):
        return {
            'pathway_validation': analyze_genetic_evidence(target),
            'expression_profile': check_tissue_expression(target),
            'safety_signals': analyze_off_targets(target),
            'clinical_precedence': find_similar_mechanisms(),
            'academic_publications': count_recent_papers(target)
        }
```

#### 3. Academic Output Formats
- **ChemDraw files** (.cdx)
- **SDF files** for virtual screening
- **Pathway diagrams** (KEGG/Reactome)
- **Patent landscape reports**
- **Grant proposal templates**

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Core Cleanup
- Remove repurposing logic
- Focus on discontinued/shelved drugs only
- Add chemical structure fields

### Week 3-4: Patent Integration
- USPTO API integration
- Google Patents scraping
- Patent expiry tracking

### Week 5-6: Global Expansion
- Multi-language press releases
- International regulatory databases
- Conference abstract mining

### Week 7-8: Academic Features
- Chemical scaffold analysis
- Downloadable structure files
- Mechanism visualization

## Example Use Cases

### 1. "Find all kinase inhibitors shelved in Phase 2"
- Returns chemical structures
- Reasons for discontinuation
- Patent status
- Similar scaffolds that succeeded

### 2. "Show GPCR modulators discontinued for business reasons"
- Filters out safety failures
- Highlights market/strategic discontinuations
- Provides synthesis routes

### 3. "Analyze failed Alzheimer's drugs with BBB penetration"
- Chemical property filtering
- Mechanistic diversity analysis
- Academic collaboration opportunities

## Key Differentiators

1. **Global Coverage**: Beyond US clinical trials
2. **Chemical Focus**: Structures, not just names
3. **Academic Friendly**: Free, open-source, citable
4. **Derisk Tools**: Mechanistic validation included
5. **Collaboration Ready**: Find other labs working on similar scaffolds

## Metrics of Success

- Number of chemical scaffolds catalogued
- Global coverage (countries represented)
- Academic citations
- Successful drug rescues
- Grant funding enabled
