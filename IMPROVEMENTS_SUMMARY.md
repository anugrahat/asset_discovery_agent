# Drug Asset Discovery CLI - Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Network Connectivity Problems**
- **Issue**: DNS resolution failures for PubMed (eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and DuckDuckGo APIs
- **Solution**: 
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
  - Modified HTTP client to return empty dict instead of raising exceptions
  - Disabled SSL verification for problematic domains
  - Created DNS resolver helper for future fallback mechanisms

### 2. **CLI Focus and Output**
- **Issue**: Originally focused on drug repurposing, needed broader asset discovery focus
- **Solution**: 
  - Renamed and refactored CLI to "Drug Asset Discovery"
  - Added comprehensive output showing data sources, program status, and shelving reasons
  - Improved star rating display and asset categorization

### 3. **Error Handling**
- **Issue**: NoneType iteration errors when processing drug status
- **Solution**: Added null checks and safe default values for status display

### 4. **Drug Interaction API**
- **Issue**: RxNav API was retired in January 2024
- **Solution**: Integrated OpenFDA drug label API as alternative for drug interactions

## Current Capabilities

The improved CLI now:
- ✅ Discovers high-potential drug assets across all development stages
- ✅ Handles network failures gracefully with retry logic
- ✅ Provides detailed scoring breakdowns (see SCORING_SYSTEM.md)
- ✅ Shows data sources contributing to each asset's profile
- ✅ Classifies drugs by program status and shelving reasons
- ✅ Uses FDA labels for drug interaction data
- ✅ Works even when some APIs are unavailable

## Example Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python drug_asset_discovery_cli_clean.py "diabetes" --top 10

# With more trials for comprehensive analysis
python drug_asset_discovery_cli_clean.py "lung cancer" --top 5 --max-trials 20

# Save results to file
python drug_asset_discovery_cli_clean.py "alzheimer's" --output results.json
```

## API Dependencies

The tool integrates with:
- **ChEMBL**: Drug targets and bioactivity (working)
- **ClinicalTrials.gov**: Trial data (working)
- **PubMed**: Literature search (DNS issues, fails gracefully)
- **FDA APIs**: Safety data (DNS issues, fails gracefully)
- **OpenAI**: LLM analysis (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
- **PatentsView**: Patent data (requires PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY)

## Known Limitations

1. Some government APIs (FDA, PubMed) have DNS resolution issues in current environment
2. Patent data unavailable without PatentsView API key
3. LLM features require OpenAI API key
4. Web search functionality limited due to DuckDuckGo DNS issues

Despite these limitations, the tool still provides valuable drug asset discovery insights using available data sources.
