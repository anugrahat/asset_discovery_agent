# Omics Oracle Benchmark Suite

## Core Value Propositions to Prove

### 1. Speed Benchmark
**Hypothesis**: Omics Oracle is 10-100x faster than manual searches

**Method**:
- Select 5 well-studied kinases (EGFR, BRAF, JAK2, CDK4/6, BTK)
- Time manual process: ChEMBL search → filter IC50 → PubMed validation → PDB check
- Time Oracle: Single query
- Measure: Time reduction percentage

### 2. Discovery Benchmark
**Hypothesis**: Oracle finds more relevant compounds than manual search

**Method**:
- For each target, compare:
  - Total inhibitors found
  - Inhibitors meeting IC50 threshold
  - Inhibitors with structural data
  - Inhibitors with clinical data
- Measure: % improvement in discovery

### 3. Clinical Relevance Benchmark
**Hypothesis**: Oracle identifies FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates

**Method**:
- Query targets with known approved drugs
- Check if Oracle finds:
  - Gefitinib/Erlotinib for EGFR
  - Vemurafenib/Dabrafenib for BRAF
  - Ruxolitinib for JAK2
  - Venetoclax for BCL2
- Measure: % of approved drugs captured

### 4. Disease-Centric Benchmark
**Hypothesis**: Disease queries yield clinically relevant targets

**Method**:
- Test disease queries:
  - "Non-small cell lung cancer" → EGFR, ALK, ROS1
  - "Chronic myeloid leukemia" → BCR-ABL
  - "Melanoma" → BRAF, MEK
- Validate against clinical guidelines
- Measure: Precision/recall of target identification

### 5. Novel Target Benchmark
**Hypothesis**: Oracle accelerates research on emerging targets

**Method**:
- Query recent targets (2020+ publications):
  - SARS-CoV-2 proteins
  - Novel oncology targets
  - Rare disease proteins
- Compare to manual literature review
- Measure: Time to actionable insights

## Metrics to Track

### Quantitative Metrics:
- **Latency**: Time per query (target: <60s)
- **Coverage**: % of known inhibitors found
- **Precision**: % of results that are relevant
- **Clinical alignment**: % overlap with approved drugs

### Qualitative Metrics:
- **Usability**: Can non-experts use it effectively?
- **Actionability**: Do results lead to next steps?
- **Trust**: Do experts validate the results?

## Real-World Validation

Partner with academic labs to:
1. Replace their current workflow with Oracle
2. Track time saved
3. Monitor quality of compounds selected
4. Follow up on experimental validation

## Publication Strategy

Demonstrate value through:
1. Case studies of successful drug repurposing
2. Time-motion studies vs traditional methods
3. Comprehensive target analysis comparisons
4. User testimonials from researchers

This positions Omics Oracle as an essential tool for:
- Academic drug discovery labs
- Biotech target validation teams
- Pharmaceutical repurposing efforts
- Clinical researchers exploring treatment options
