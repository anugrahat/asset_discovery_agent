          "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. In recent years, the therapeutic arsenal of locally advanced or metastatic ATC has been expanded, with V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-MAPKK  inhibitors for the subset of -mutant ATC. For  wild-type ATC and without other actionable alterations, the most promising strategy is certainly immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown activities both in monotherapy or in combination regimens. However, access to novel treatments is heterogeneous worldwide for ATC patients, and activity of immunotherapy as a single agent is limited. We report the case of a patient with locally advanced  wild-type ATC who achieved a near-complete and durable response following a multimodal treatment approach combining chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), and external beam radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was continued as maintenance therapy, and disease control was maintained for over 1 year. This case highlights the potential efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in  wild-type ATC, especially when a rapid tumor reduction is required. It supports the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with cytotoxic agents as a viable therapeutic option in this aggressive tumor subtype.",

          "abstract": "Melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, is commonly associated by mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly BRAFV600E, which drives tumor proliferation via ERK1/2 signaling cascade. While BRAF inhibitors initially demonstrate efficacy, therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence implicates the cAMP signaling pathway, particularly the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and its repressor, Inducible cAMP Early Repressor (ICER), in melanoma progression and drug resistance. ICER, a transcriptional repressor regulated via Ras/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination, is degraded in melanoma, undermining its tumor-suppressive role. In a brafV600E; p53(loss of function) transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model, we investigated the role of a ubiquitin-resistant ICER mutant (S35-41A-ICER) in tumor progression. Transgenic fish expressing S35-41A-ICER exhibited extended survival and reduced tumor invasiveness compared to wild-type ICER. RNA sequencing revealed dysregulation of CREB/CREM targets and compensatory pathways, including Rap1 and PI3K/AKT signaling, as well as candidate gene targets of ICER regulation, including the Protein Kinase A catalytic subunit prkacaa. Our findings suggest that a ubiquitin resistant ICER mitigates melanoma progression and represses oncogenic pathways in a brafV600E melanoma context.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Most patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma eventually develop resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) and immune-checkpoint blockade. Emerging evidence from retrospective cohorts indicates promising activity from re-exposure to BRAF/MEKi after a treatment-free interval of targeted therapy (TT), probably due to tumor regression and proliferation of sensitive clones. However, there is limited prospective evidence on this approach. METHODS/PATIENTS: GEM1801 is a prospective observational study by the Spanish Melanoma Group (GEM), including 1123 patients treated at 37 centers. We conducted a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for the 24 patients who received a second course of BRAF/MEKi, either as retreatment (after relapse following prior adjuvant TT) or rechallenge (following prior progression on TT in the metastatic setting). RESULTS: Five patients underwent retreatment, and 19 received rechallenge. The BRAF/MEKi median free interval for retreatment was 20.9\u00a0months (range 12.4-57.3), with an ORR of 20%, and median PFS and OS of 5.5 and 8.4\u00a0months, respectively. The median free interval of TT for rechallenge was 6.8\u00a0months, with an ORR of 31.6%, and median PFS and OS of 5.7 and 7.6\u00a0months. Patients with ECOG\u2009\u2264\u20091 experienced longer survival with rechallenge (8.2 vs 4.3\u00a0months; HR 9.07 [95% CI 1.37-59.8]; p\u2009=\u20090.022). CONCLUSION: Retreatment or rechallenge with BRAF/MEKi in the metastatic setting has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma who lack therapeutic alternatives to prolong survival. Therefore, in our experience, it may represent a valid therapeutic strategy for selected patients. CLINICALTRIALS: GOV: NCT03605771 (REGISTRATION DATE: 20-07-2018): NCT03605771.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is notorious for its aggressive growth, metastatic spread, and heterogeneous response to therapy across BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase) genotypes. While BRAF inhibitors improve outcomes in V600E-mutant tumors, their benefit is limited in wild-type melanomas and by transient responses in mutant disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) driven angiogenesis and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) mediated immunosuppression each sculpt a permissive tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that simultaneous blockade of both axes with SYHA1813, which currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials in China for solid tumor treatment, would yield a broadly applicable, microenvironment-targeted strategy for melanoma treatment. METHODS: Subcutaneous xenograft models of BRAF wild-type (MeWo) and BRAF V600E-mutant (A375) melanoma were established (NOD-SCID mice), alongside an intracardiac metastasis model (Nude mice) using GFP-Luc-labeled A375 cells. SYHA1813 (2.5\u00a0mg/kg or 5\u00a0mg/kg), alone or combined with vemurafenib (20\u00a0mg/kg), was administered to assess tumor growth, metastatic burden, and microenvironmental modulation. Tumor growth inhibition rates and synergistic effects were quantified. The markers of angiogenesis, macrophage polarization and cell proliferation were analyzed via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SYHA1813 monotherapy exhibited significant antitumor efficacy in BRAF wild-type MeWo and BRAF V600E-mutant A375 melanoma xenograft models at 5\u00a0mg/kg, achieving 72.5% and 79.8% tumor growth inhibition, respectively, surpassing vemurafenib in BRAF wild-type tumors. Treatment regimens were well tolerated, with no significant body weight changes observed. Mechanistically, SYHA1813 suppressed angiogenesis, attenuated M2 macrophage infiltration, and inhibited tumor cell proliferation as marked by reduced CD31, CD105, F4/80, CD206 and Ki67 expression. Moreover, we evaluated the combination of SYHA1813 with vemurafenib in BRAF V600E-mutant models and found that 2.5\u00a0mg/kg SYHA1813 treatment synergized with vemurafenib, enhancing tumor suppression to 72.9% inhibition compared to each monotherapy (38.9% and 34.7%, respectively). Furthermore, we established a systemic intracardiac metastasis mouse model to assess the impact of SYHA1813 on melanoma metastasis. The results showed that SYHA1813 reduced systemic metastasis by 76.6%, significantly curtailing brain and bone metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Dual targeting of VEGFR2 and CSF1R with SYHA1813 confers a novel microenvironmentcentric strategy for treating both BRAF wildtype and mutant melanoma. By concurrently disrupting angiogenesis and macrophagemediated immunosuppression, SYHA1813 demonstrates strong therapeutic and antimetastatic activity to melanoma, warranting further clinical development as monotherapy or in combination with BRAF V600E inhibitors.",

Traditional invasive treatment for vascular malformations includes embolo-sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy and surgery. However, surgical or minimally invasive treatment is rarely optimal due to the risk of treatment complications, and a complete cure is often difficult to achieve. Targeted therapy can be guided by the current understanding of molecular signalling pathways and disease classifications. Existing and novel medical treatments target the major cellular signalling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular malformations: mTOR inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphsophate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) inhibitors, and AKT inhibitors are being developed to target the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway, while mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors and BRAF inhibitor are being researched to target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Angiogenesis inhibitors are also utilised in the treatment of vascular abnormalities. This review aims to discuss the evolving medical therapy available in the treatment of Vascular Malformations.",

          "abstract": "The cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis controls heterotrimeric G proteins, and mutations reducing GTPase activity result in constitutive G protein signaling. In G\u03b1q (gene: GNAQ) such mutations cause uveal melanoma and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Finding pharmacological agents that inhibit G\u03b1q will be beneficial for research with therapeutic potential. Previously discovered bacterial depsipeptides (FR900359 and YM-254890) bind directly to G\u03b1q and stabilize its inactive complex with GDP, but suffer from limitations of distribution and bioavailability. We used the established G\u03b1q-YM-254890 complex structure to dock small-molecule drugs into the depsipeptide binding site of G\u03b1q. Our in silico screen of 5000 Food Drug and Administration-approved, experimental, and withdrawn drugs predicted that thiazolidinediones are potential ligands of G\u03b1q. Analysis of G protein coupled receptor-stimulated G protein GTP\u03b3S binding demonstrated that troglitazone (441 Da) inhibited Gq nucleotide exchange with the IC of \u223c31.7 \u03bcM. The thiazolidinedione analogs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, had no effect. High concentrations of troglitazone modestly inhibited Gi and Gs, but not G13. In G protein thermal stability assays, troglitazone and FR900359 stabilized purified G\u03b1q-GDP, indicating direct binding. Consistent with its negative effect on Gq signaling, in MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells, troglitazone inhibited Ca mobilization, extracellular regulated protein kinase phosphorylation, and insulin secretion stimulated by the Gq-coupled M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Troglitazone and FR900359 inhibited proliferation of MEL92.1 uveal melanoma cells driven by a GNAQ-Q209L driver mutation, but not of SK-MEL-28 cells driven by BRAF-V600E. Together, our study shows that troglitazone may be a promising new lead for the development of a <500 Da small-molecule therapeutic G\u03b1q inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Troglitazone, unlike other thiazolidinediones, directly binds and inhibits activity of heterotrimeric G protein Gq, with a weaker effect on Gi. Troglitazone may find usage as a repurposed drug scaffold to build novel small-molecule G\u03b1q inhibitors with better bioavailability than depsipeptide G\u03b1q inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "The BRAF mutation is one of the most common genetic alterations in thyroid tumors, and intrinsic feedback mechanisms have limited the clinical application of BRAF-specific inhibitors. This study aims to investigate the potential biological function of the downstream overexpressed molecule NGEF following the BRAF mutation and its regulatory mechanisms. By integrating data from the CEO database, TCGA database, and clinical samples, we found that NGEF is highly expressed in thyroid cancer and is positively correlated with tumor size, local lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and disease-free survival. Intriguingly, analysis of TCGA data revealed that NGEF expression is significantly higher in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers. Subsequent validation demonstrated that NGEF expression is markedly elevated in BRAF-mutant cancer cell lines and BRAF-engineered cellular models compared to normal cells and BRAF-negative cancer cells. Functional experiments, pathway enrichment analysis, and investigations into phenotype-associated biomarkers further revealed that NGEF promotes invasion and migration of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. To explore the regulatory relationship between the BRAF mutation and NGEF expression, we used bioinformatics tools to predict transcription factors, conducted pathway inhibition experiments, and performed dual-luciferase reporter assays. These studies confirmed that BRAF regulates NGEF expression via the ERK/AP1 pathway. These findings suggest that NGEF enhances the invasive and migratory abilities of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells through BRAF/ERK/AP1 upregulation and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors poses an ongoing clinical challenge. We investigated molecularly matched combination therapies for treatment-refractory GIST, including drugs not previously combined in human studies. METHODS: Patients of all ages with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST treated with combination therapies were included (February 13, 2015-December 31, 2022). These patients were discussed at molecular tumor board and enrolled in the prospective Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (I-PREDICT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02534675). Patient demographics, tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS), treatment responses, and survival outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Six (1.6%) patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 59.5 years with the majority (4/6) of patients being male. NGS revealed median of six deleterious genomic alterations per patient excluding variants of unknown significance. Five (5/6) patients had -mutant GIST, and one patient had -mutant GIST. Two thirds of tumors had  loss. Patients received median of 1 (range, 1-3) customized combination therapy consisting of median of 2 (range, 2-3) drugs targeting median of 2 (range, 2-4) genomic alterations. One patient experienced a treatment-related grade \u22653 adverse event (hypertension). For all patients, the best response by RECIST v1.1 was stable disease (SD). Combination therapies led to SD \u22656 months (range, 6.2-11.3 months) in four (4/6) patients compared with none in the immediate previous single-agent targeted therapies (SD range, 1.5-5.4 months). Most (5/6) patients had at least 60% prolongation of their progression-free survival compared with their immediate previous single-agent targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a multitargeted, biomarker-matched combination approach can be safely administered to obtain disease control. Tailored combination therapies for advanced GIST with multiple genomic alterations warrant further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Targeting the cell cycle has become a focus of cancer research bearing impressive results with the introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, no definitive benefit in other cancers has been observed. In gastrointestinal cancers, despite preclinical studies pinpointing positive effects on cancer inhibition in pre-clinical models, no positive clinical trials have been published with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Several biomarkers have been proposed in breast cancers, where the field is more advanced, and include up-regulations of the inhibited kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and their partner cyclin D as well as the main target of phosphorylation, RB. Up-regulation of Cyclin E, an E2F1/RB regulated gene, also arises as a marker of CDK4/6 inhibition resistance. Signaling from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways through KRAS/BRAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are also implicated in feedback CDK4/6 activation and inhibitors resistance. In gastrointestinal cancers, some of these biomarkers have also proven valuable in predicting sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors and would lead markers to guide clinical development. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment, where immune cells are prominent components, arises as a feature of CDK4/6 inhibition and could be harnessed in therapeutic combinations.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene fusions exist with low prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC), and the clinical utility of fusion testing in advanced CRC remains unclear. We sought to identify oncogenic fusions in patients with advanced CRC using a fusion partner-agnostic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay to better understand their clinical relevance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using de-identified data from 18,558 patients with advanced CRC who underwent ctDNA next-generation sequencing with Guardant360 from 2017 to 2022. These samples were subsequently reanalyzed with a partner-agnostic bioinformatics method to identify both clonal and non-clonal fusions. We analyzed for associations between fusions and MSI-H status, as well prior EGFR-directed therapy signature. RESULTS: Fusions were identified in 221 (1.3%) of CRC patients analyzed. 193 patients had 258 activating fusions, while 28 patients had fusions of uncertain significance. Among patients with activating fusions, there were 18 clonal fusions (7%) and 240 (93%) subclonal fusions. Clonal fusions were more common in patients with MSI-H status, and subclonal fusions were associated with prior EGFR exposure signature. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CRC, partner-agnostic ctDNA fusion detection is possible and improves identification as a blood-based approach by extension of fusion calling partners. Detection of fusions in the ctDNA may provide rationale for potential therapeutic strategies according to clonality as informed by the ctDNA, whereas subclonal fusions may play a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF tumors.",

          "abstract": "This review provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular biology and therapeutic advances regarding papillary craniopharyngiomas (PCP), with a particular focus on the pivotal role of the BRAF V600E mutation in its pathogenesis. Histopathologically, PCPs are characterized by stratified squamous epithelium and are frequently associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. This mutation activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which drives tumor development and progression. The identification of this pathway has led to significant progress in targeted therapies, specifically with the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in clinical trials. These inhibitors can effectively reduce tumor size and improve clinical outcomes for patients. However, despite these advancements, there are challenges such as the potential for resistance to these therapies and the management of long-term side effects. Consequently, a multidisciplinary approach that combines surgical resection, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy is often recommended to enhance treatment efficacy although minimizing adverse effects. In addition to adult cases, this review also addresses rare instances of pediatric PCP. Although these cases are infrequent, their molecular characteristics closely resemble those of adult PCP, suggesting that similar therapeutic approaches might be applicable. Looking ahead, future research should focus on optimizing treatment regimens, understanding the interactions within the tumor's immune microenvironment, and identifying novel therapeutic targets. These efforts are crucial for enhancing precision medicine strategies for PCP patients, ultimately improving their quality of life and long-term prognosis. Overall, continued exploration in this field holds promise for more effective and tailored treatment options.",

          "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Drugs targeting mutant BRAF and MEK oncogenes are effective in melanoma, even though resistance rapidly develops. This complex picture includes acquired intrinsic tumor and tumor microenvironmental-mediated mechanisms. Here we show that melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) overexpress the rate-limiting enzymes involved in nicotinamide (NAM) metabolism nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). Remarkably, these cells release NAMPT and NNMT both in the free-form or loaded into extracellular vesicles (EVs). NAMPT is emerging as a key mediator of resistance to BRAFi in melanoma, primarily due to its established role in NAD biosynthesis. Although previously identified as a soluble extracellular factor in this tumor, its presence within EVs released by melanoma cells has not been reported until now, highlighting a previously unrecognized mechanism through which NAMPT may influence the tumor microenvironment (TME). NNMT was revealed to increase in melanoma lesions compared to benign nevi. Here, we report for the first time its overexpression in resistant melanoma cell lines at intracellular and extracellular levels (secreted both as a soluble factor and into EVs). NNMT expression is increased in BRAF-mutated melanoma patients, suggesting a link between its upregulation and the BRAF oncogenic signaling. Moreover, NNMT levels positively correlate with gene signatures associated with pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell migration, and chemokine-mediated pathways. NNMT pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing significantly reduce resistant melanoma cell growth. In addition, we found that BRAFi-resistant cells are more sensitive to NNMT inhibition, highlighting a trait of vulnerability of BRAFi-resistant melanomas. Lastly, we proposed for the first time a tetrameric NNMT:TLR4 binding model offering a plausible structural and mechanistic basis for their association. Our functional results indicated that exogenous NNMT treatment is able to trigger NF-\u03baB pathway, one of the main TLR4-dependent signaling, sharing this cytokine-like properties with NAMPT, and opening a future deeper exploration of its functional role in the extracellular space. Overall, the identification of NAMPT and, surprisingly also NNMT, included in EVs and abundantly released from resistant melanoma cells supports the impact of these moonlighting proteins involved in nicotinamide metabolism as mediators of BRAF/MEK inhibitors resistance with tumor intrinsic and potentially tumor microenvironment-mediated mechanisms. Interfering with nicotinamide metabolism could be a valid strategy to counteract drug resistance acting on the multifactorial tumor-host interactions.

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prognostic impact of the BRAF V600E mutation in patients with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is poorly understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective international study included patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC treated with ICI all lines between 2014 and 2023, and available BRAF mutation status. RESULTS: Of 909 patients included, 345 (38\u202f%) had BRAF V600E dMMR/MSI mCRC. In multivariable analysis, BRAFm was not associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ICI start compared to BRAFwt patients (median PFS: 25.0 vs 41.5 months, adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR)=\u202f0.97, p\u202f=\u202f0.8 and OS: 55.1 months vs not reached adjHR=\u202f0.98, p\u202f=\u202f0.9). However, in patients treated with ICI in first line, the rate of secondary resistance, defined as the progression after the first 6 months of treatment, was higher in BRAFm patients (20\u202f% vs 11\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In patients with disease control for 6 months in 1st line, the PFS and OS from this point onwards were significantly shorter in BRAFm patients (adjHR for PFS 2.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.03 and adjHR for OS 2.80, p\u202f=\u202f0.019). The poor prognostic value of the BRAF mutation was no longer observed in patients treated with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC, the BRAF V600E mutation is not associated with a shorter PFS/OS on ICI treatment in the overall population across all lines. However, specifically in patients treated in the first-line setting, our results suggest that the BRAF mutation is associated with a higher rate of secondary resistance, suggesting that a combination of PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors upfront may be of particular interest in these patients.",

          "abstract": "A new group of thiadiazole-benzenesulfonamide hybrids was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as potential dual inhibitors targeting B-Raf and VEGFR-2 for cancer therapy. The cytotoxic activity of the synthesized derivatives was assessed against HepG2 and Huh7 liver cancer cell lines, where compound 7a exhibited the most potent activity with IC values of 17.89\u2009\u03bcM and 25.07\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. The kinase inhibition assay revealed that 7a strongly inhibited both B-Raf (IC\u2009=\u20090.11\u2009\u03bcM) and VEGFR-2 (IC\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009\u03bcM), surpassing sorafenib in B-Raf inhibition. Further mechanistic studies revealed that 7a induced G2/M phase arrest, with a significant increase in late apoptotic cells (57.08%) compared to the control group (0.15%), confirming its pro-apoptotic effect. The apoptotic pathway was further validated by caspase-3 activation, Bax upregulation, and Bcl-2 downregulation. Computational analyses verified the effective binding of compound 7a to VEGFR-2. These analyses included molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA), protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (ProLIF), principal component analysis (PCAT), and free energy landscape (FEL) studies. Additionally, DFT studies indicated 7a's stability and reactivity. In silico ADMET predictions indicated that the derivatives had good absorption, were non-mutagenic, non-carcinogenic, and exhibited low toxicity risks compared to sorafenib. These findings suggest that the synthesized thiadiazole-benzenesulfonamide hybrids, particularly 7a, represent promising dual BRAF/VEGFR-2 inhibitors with potent anti-cancer activity, warranting further optimization and preclinical evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Drug resistance critically limits the long-term efficacy of MAPK-targeted therapy in melanoma. While resistance mechanisms at genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional scales are well-documented, post-transcriptional splicing regulation remains poorly understood. By analyzing patient-matched pre-treatment and resistant melanoma biopsies, we uncover widespread alternative splicing alterations during therapy resistance. Splicing perturbations are most pronounced in MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathway genes. We identify a splicing switch of AKT2 from isoform 210 to 206 in 29.55% (13/44) of disease-progressive biopsies. This splicing switch induces AKT2 kinase hyperactivity by restoring the activated fragment A-loop. Functional validations confirm that AKT2-206 confers BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma cells by activating S6 kinase. Further, the splicing factor hnRNPK likely drives the splicing switch of AKT2 during acquired resistance. Our results not only provide insights into splicing-mediated regulation of drug resistance but also highlight the importance of alternative splicing isoforms as targets for clinical diagnosis and therapy.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype with poor prognosis. Outcomes to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and genomic features in PSC remain underexplored compared to other NSCLC subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from three institutions and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) with metastatic NSCLC treated with ICI alone or with chemotherapy were identified. Clinicogenomics and treatment outcomes were compared across PSC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). RESULTS: We analyzed 4,841 patients including 165 PSC cases treated with ICI-based therapy from three institutions, and 201 PSC from NCDB. In MDACC, 65 (4.3%) were PSC, 1,138 (75.1%) LUAD, and 312 (20.6%) LUSC. PSC patients were older and more likely to present with metastatic disease. In both the MDACC and NCDB cohorts, ICIs resulted in better outcomes for PSC patients compared with chemotherapy. In these patients, there was no difference in outcome between ICI-monotherapy and ICI-chemotherapy. Across the three institutional cohorts, 37%-43% of patients with PSC who received ICIs were responders, compared to 26%-29% in LUAD and 22%-46% in LUSC (P < 0.05). Improved ICI outcomes in PSC appeared driven by high PD-L1 (\u226550% in 73%-77% cases). Among patients with high PD-L1, response rates were similar across histologic subtypes. Conversely, TMB was similar in PSC compared to LUAD/LUSC, and was not associated with ICI outcomes. Across cohorts, PSC tumors were enriched for TP53, NF1, NF2, and NRAS, with relative depletion of STK11 and KEAP1 compared to LUAD. Case observation showed relatively better outcomes to ICI than targeted therapies in PSC patients with MET exon 14 skipping or KRAS G12C. CONCLUSION: PSC exhibits improved outcomes to ICI relative to other therapies, potentially driven by high PD-L1 expression. Genomic analysis highlights a distinct genomic landscape of PSC when compared with LUAD.",

Spirocyclization led to the discovery of BI-2493, a highly rigid analogue exhibiting better potency, metabolic stability, and permeability. BI-2493 shows  efficacy in various KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type amplified xenograft models and represents a promising starting point for further optimization.",

Recent studies have revealed that ubiquitination dynamically regulates the stability, membrane localization, and signaling transduction of RAS proteins, profoundly impacting their oncogenic functions. A series of ubiquitination sites, E3 ligases, deubiquitinases, and regulatory proteins are involved in RAS ubiquitination. We also analyze the heterogeneity of ubiquitination patterns across distinct RAS isoforms (KRAS4A, KRAS4B, NRAS, and HRAS) and their functional disparities in cancers. Targeting the ubiquitination pathway offers novel strategies to overcome RAS proteins. Future research should integrate protein structure analysis and high-throughput screening to develop specific ubiquitination modulators and explore combination RAS ubiquitination targeting strategies with RAS inhibitors or immunotherapy, aiming to overcome RAS-driven malignant phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene fusions exist with low prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC), and the clinical utility of fusion testing in advanced CRC remains unclear. We sought to identify oncogenic fusions in patients with advanced CRC using a fusion partner-agnostic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay to better understand their clinical relevance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using de-identified data from 18,558 patients with advanced CRC who underwent ctDNA next-generation sequencing with Guardant360 from 2017 to 2022. These samples were subsequently reanalyzed with a partner-agnostic bioinformatics method to identify both clonal and non-clonal fusions. We analyzed for associations between fusions and MSI-H status, as well prior EGFR-directed therapy signature. RESULTS: Fusions were identified in 221 (1.3%) of CRC patients analyzed. 193 patients had 258 activating fusions, while 28 patients had fusions of uncertain significance. Among patients with activating fusions, there were 18 clonal fusions (7%) and 240 (93%) subclonal fusions. Clonal fusions were more common in patients with MSI-H status, and subclonal fusions were associated with prior EGFR exposure signature. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CRC, partner-agnostic ctDNA fusion detection is possible and improves identification as a blood-based approach by extension of fusion calling partners. Detection of fusions in the ctDNA may provide rationale for potential therapeutic strategies according to clonality as informed by the ctDNA, whereas subclonal fusions may play a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF tumors.",

          "abstract": "MEF2D fusions are found in a special subtype of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with poor prognosis. In this study, we conducted high-throughput drug screenings using cell line and ex vivo cell model harboring, respectively, MEF2D::HNRNPUL1(MH) and MEF2D::BCL9(MB), the two major MEF2D fusions. We identified CUDC-907 as a highly potent dual-target inhibitor of PI3K/HDAC, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in inducing robust lethality while maintaining selectivity for MEF2D fusion-expressing cells. CUDC-907 effectively induced apoptosis and promoted the down-regulation of pre-BCR signaling. We discovered that the hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, HDAC9, and BCL2 contributed to the sustained state of MEF2D fusion (+) BCP-ALL. Importantly, CUDC-907 exerted dual regulatory function by targeting the integrative pathways of MEF2D fusions. It suppressed the PI3K-CREB pathway and fusion gene expression, while simultaneously inhibited transcriptional activity regulated by the MEF2D fusion-HDAC axis. CUDC-907 demonstrated remarkable efficacy in patient samples carrying distinct MEF2D fusion variants in vitro. Furthermore, this compound's effectiveness and safety were confirmed in both MH/NRAS BCP-ALL mouse model and MB patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, outperforming conventional therapies. These results support the therapeutic potential of dual-pathway inhibition in MEF2D fusion (+) BCP-ALL and suggest CUDC-907 as a promising candidate for precision treatment in fusion-driven leukemias with similar molecular dependencies.",

          "abstract": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSC) is an uncommon subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, often arising in association with serous borderline tumors (SBT). Compared to high-grade serous ovarian cancers, LGSCs often occur in younger patients and are relatively insensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, though some patients with LGSC can benefit from hormonal therapies. Genomic studies have demonstrated that SBT and LGSC frequently harbor mutations in members of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway, which can be targeted therapeutically. LGSC harbor mutations in KRAS (up to 54\u00a0%, primarily non-G12C mutations), NRAS, and BRAF. Treatment of recurrent LGSC with the MEK inhibitor trametinib demonstrated improved clinical outcomes relative to other treatment options (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) in a phase 3 trial. Other MEK inhibitors have also shown efficacy in LGSC, with some studies demonstrating higher response rates in patients whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations. However, some trials of MEK inhibitors showed more limited benefit (e.g. binimetinib), and RAS pathway mutations do not always correlate with increased efficacy, highlighting the need for further clinical and translational research in RAS-MEK-ERK pathway targeted therapeutics. Current clinical trials are evaluating MEK inhibitor combinations such as MEK inhibitors plus inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), AKT, PI3K, CDK4/6, or BCL2/BCL-XL. Novel approaches to targeting the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway include the RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib, which has been evaluated in combination with the FAK inhibitor defactinib, and this combination received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval in 2025. Multiple newly developed inhibitors of KRAS, including KRAS G12C or G12D inhibitors, as well as pan-RAS inhibitors, including RAS (ON) inhibitors such as RMC-6236, are being evaluated in solid tumors. These emerging strategies for inhibiting RAS-MEK-ERK pathway activity may offer new treatment options for patients with LGSC.",

          "abstract": "Mutations activating RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling are associated with poor outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but therapeutic targeting of this pathway is challenging. Here, we employ a structure-based, dynamic RAS pathway model to successfully predict RAF inhibitor (RAFi) combinations which synergistically suppress ERK signaling in -mutant AML. Our  models predicted therapeutic synergy of two iterations of conformation-specific RAF inhibitors: Type I\u00bd + Type II and Type I + Type II. Predictions were validated  in AML cell lines and patient samples, with synergy verified by the Loewe Additivity model. Lifirafenib (Type II) + encorafenib (Type I\u00bd) was highly synergistic against both - and -mutant lines, while synergy of lifirafenib + SB590885 (Type I) was specific to -mutants. Immunoblotting confirmed that combination efficacy correlated strongly with decreased RAS pathway activation. Leveraging the pharmacokinetic predictions of our  model, both combinations were then assessed in a pre-clinical -mutant AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, showing significantly improved leukaemia growth delay and event-free survival compared with single agent approaches. Assessment of leukemia burden in bone marrow and spleen during treatment further showed site-specific efficacy against circulating and spleen-resident blasts for both combinations. In summary, we report that our structure based-modelling approach can effectively identify novel, non-obvious, and well-tolerated RAFi combinations that are highly effective against  and  models, thereby suggesting alternative potential therapeutic strategies for high-risk -mutant AML.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds promise for guiding immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and stratifying responders from non-responders. While tumor-informed ctDNA detection approaches are sensitive and mutation-inclusive, they require tumor tissue, which limits applicability in real-world settings. Conversely, tumor-agnostic methods often have limited genomic coverage. In this study, we evaluated a tumor-agnostic, broad-panel ctDNA assay in patients with advanced melanoma treated with ICI. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 241 longitudinal samples from 39 patients with unresectable stage III/IV melanoma using a SYSMEX targeted NGS panel covering 1,114 COSMIC mutations. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and during ICI therapy. The assay's sensitivity reached seven mutant molecules, corresponding to a 0.07% mutation allele frequency (MAF). ctDNA profiles were compared with matched tumor tissue and correlated with clinical features and survival. RESULTS: At baseline, ctDNA was detected in 64.5% of patients. Common mutations included BRAF (43.8%) and NRAS (36.4%), followed by KRAS, EGFR, and PIK3CA variants. Overall tissue-plasma concordance was 51.6%, with more extended biopsy-plasma intervals associated with discordance (p\u2009=\u20090.0105). Notably, 12.2% of cases exhibited partial concordance, characterized by shared mutations and additional plasma-only alterations, underscoring the complementary value of blood-based profiling. Persistent or re-emerging ctDNA positivity post-therapy correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS, p\u2009=\u20090.003), while ctDNA-negative patients showed significantly improved outcomes. Patients that remained ctDNA-negative had significantly longer progression-free survival (median not reached) compared to those with persistent ctDNA positivity (median 3\u00a0months) or those converting to positive (median 7.5\u00a0months; p\u2009=\u20090.0073). Early NRAS and KRAS ctDNA levels strongly predicted poor response (p\u2009=\u20090.0069 and p\u2009=\u20090.028). The prognostic impact extended beyond canonical drivers, as non-hotspot variants also correlated with the outcome. Notably, even low-level ctDNA persistence (5-10 MM/mL) carried adverse prognostic implications (p\u2009=\u20090.0054). Concerning a shorter PFS, ctDNA positivity was also associated with elevated S100 levels (p\u2009=\u20090.047). Organ-specific mutation enrichment (e.g., KRAS in brain, EGFR in lymph nodes) suggested possible metastatic tropism. CONCLUSION: Broad tumor-agnostic ctDNA analysis effectively identified clinically relevant mutations and predicted outcomes in ICI-treated melanoma patients. This approach enables tissue-independent and real-time ctDNA monitoring and may inform patient selection and therapeutic strategies in future interventional trials.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The RAS family, comprising KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, plays a pivotal role in oncogenesis, dynamically regulating cellular processes through intricate cycling between active and inactive states. Despite recent advancements, direct therapeutic targeting of RAS proteins has proven challenging. Targeting KRASG12D with natural compounds offers a unique therapeutic potential, leveraging the structural diversity and bioactivity of natural compounds. In this study, we investigated the potential of natural products to target oncogenic KRASG12D mutant. Given the higher prevalence of KRASG12D mutations, our study employs structure-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations to identify potential KRASG12D inhibitors within a natural compound library. RESULTS: Two natural compounds, NPA019556 and NPA032945, demonstrated strong and stable binding interactions with KRASG12D, surpassing the performance of known inhibitor MRTX1133. After post-molecular dynamics analyses, which encompass Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix and Principal Component Analysis, additional evidence suggests that the flexible switch I (residues 30-40) and switch II (residues 58-72) regions demonstrate greater anti-correlation in NPA019556 and NPA032945 compared to MRTX1133 complexed with KRASG12D. These findings highlight the promise of two natural compounds, NPA019556 and NPA032945, as specific KRASG12D inhibitors, paving the way for future and therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canine oral melanoma (COM) is an aggressive and often fatal neoplasm in dogs, with clinical and molecular similarities to human melanoma. Despite its relevance as a comparative oncology model, the molecular mechanisms underlying COM remain poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize gene expression profiles in COM to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), potential biomarkers, and therapeutic targets. METHODS: In this pilot study, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on tumor and healthy oral tissue samples from dogs. Two independent analytical pipelines-Bowtie2-DESeq2 and HISAT-StringTie-Ballgown-were used to ensure robustness in DEG detection. We also conducted pathway enrichment and isoform-level analyses to investigate biological processes and alternative splicing events. RESULTS: Both approaches identified a core set of 929 common DEGs. Key oncogenic pathways, including MAPK/ERK and cell cycle regulation, were significantly affected, with notable upregulation of BRAF, NRAS, CDK4, and MITF (log2FC = 2.86,  < 0.001). The transcription factor SOX10 and the cytokine IL-33, both previously implicated in melanoma progression, were consistently overexpressed. Additionally, NF1, a known RAS pathway inhibitor, was also upregulated. Isoform analysis revealed novel transcript variants, suggesting a complex layer of post-transcriptional regulation in COM. Many DEGs remained uncharacterized, and chromosomal distribution analysis highlighted potential genomic influences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the molecular landscape of COM, reinforcing its utility as a model for human melanoma. The identification of conserved oncogenic pathways and novel transcript variants opens avenues for further functional studies and the development of targeted therapies in both veterinary and human oncology.",

Teledermatology and skin screening mobile apps aided by artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic support could assist in closing disparity gaps in melanoma early detection and access to specialty care. Although the field of AI in dermatology has exploded over the past decade, prospective validation of available algorithms using real-world, multimodal data sets has shown performance decline, limiting their current use in clinical practice. Newer methodological approaches have focused on how AI can augment clinical decision making to speed diagnosis and care delivery-and whether the model output results in a favorable change for the patient. Selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors have an established role in the adjuvant and metastatic setting for the approximately 50% of patients whose melanomas harbor a BRAF V600 mutation. Acquired resistance to these agents remains a challenge, however. For other driver mutations, including class II and III BRAF mutations, alterations in NRAS and CDKN2A, novel agents and combinations are demonstrating promising activity. At least 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma do not derive long-term benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Adoptive cellular immunotherapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes offers the possibility of a durable response for a minority of these patients.

Despite effective control of the primary tumour, metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) occurs in approximately 20-30% of patients, primarily affecting the liver, with a poor prognosis and overall survival (OS). The unique molecular profile of UM, lacking BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations, limits targeted therapy efficacy. Chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) also show limited benefits, while tebentafusp has emerged as the first drug to improve OS, but this systemic treatment can be used only in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients. A French multidisciplinary panel developed evidence-based guidelines for MUM management presented in this review. Recommendations emphasise on comprehensive diagnosis, including liver biopsy and imaging, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis, and high-definition HLA typing for HLA-A*02:01. Local therapies are proposed for patients with limited hepatic metastases, from liver surgery to isolated hepatic perfusion and chemoembolisation for patients with more extensive hepatic involvement. Systemic therapy with tebentafusp is the standard of care for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients. For HLA-A*02:01-negative patients with extensive disease, treatment options are limited. They are encouraged to participate in a clinical trial, alternatively, percutaneous hepatic perfusion, ICI alone or in combination can be proposed. Treatment efficacy assessment includes response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), tumour growth rate (TGR) analysis, and ctDNA dynamics. This consensus provides practical guidelines for French oncologists to optimise MUM management, integrating locoregional interventions, systemic therapies, and biomarkers to enhance patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The genomic database for NSCLC is expanding rapidly, highlighting the importance of characterizing subpopulations from diverse regions. This study aims to identify and correlate genomic variants in patients with non-squamous NSCLC from two cities in Paran\u00e1, Brazil, and compare these findings with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the broader Brazilian population. We conducted a retrospective study sequencing tumor sample from 133 patients. An  analysis was performed for gene functional analysis. Additional data on tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite status, and clinicopathological characteristics were also collected. The mutational load in the studied population was comparable to that of the TCGA cohort. However, gene expression profiles differed significantly, particularly for the EGFR, TP53, KRAS-NRAS, STK11-KEAP1, MTAP-CDKN2A/B, and PDL-1 genes. The gene expression profile in this study also showed marked differences from the general Brazilian population, with notably higher expression rates of EGFR and PDL-1. Specifically, considering the PDL-1 expression levels, 14% were classified as hyper-expressors, 33% as hypo-expressors, and 52% as non-expressors. These proportions were statistically distinct from global literature but aligned with the Brazilian profile. The genomic profile of patients with NSCLC in Paran\u00e1 reveals a regional signature, characterized by a higher frequency of EGFR and TP53 mutations, along with elevated PDL-1 expression. These findings highlight the potential for regional variations in NSCLC, which could inform personalized treatment strategies for this population.",

          "title": "The complex journey of targeting RAS in oncology.",
          "abstract": "Given the prevalence of RAS mutations in various cancers, personalized therapeutic approaches, guided by molecular markers, are essential. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have emerged as potential therapeutic options; however, they also face obstacles such as toxicity and limited efficacy. Alternative strategies, such as direct inhibitors combined with pathway modulators, RNA interference, and gene-editing technologies, are under clinical investigation. The targeting of RAS, complicated by its structural nuances, particularly in the G domain, has advanced with the identification of druggable pockets such as the SW-II pocket. This breakthrough has led to the development of targeted therapeutics, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, for KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, these advancements face challenges, including adaptive resistance and the necessity for isoform selectivity. New inhibitors, such as LY3537982 or GDC-6036, are promising, but achieving effective and selective RAS inhibition remains a significant challenge. Additionally, clinical trials have highlighted variability in patient responses, attributing limited treatment efficacy to resistance mechanisms, including on-target mutations and off-target pathway activations. Finally, the RAS oncogene, traditionally viewed as predominantly pro-cancerous, plays a complex role in oncogenesis, with recent evidence suggesting context-dependent effects, such as inducing senescence in certain cells. This shift in understanding underscores the therapeutic potential of manipulating the interplay between RAS and TP53 mutations in cancer. In conclusion, the complexity of effectively targeting the RAS-RAF-ERK pathway is exacerbated by the diverse resistance mechanisms. Challenges such as off-target effects and delivery issues remain significant barriers in the introduction of effective therapies based on RAS inhibitors. This overview highlights the evolving nature of targeting RAS in cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "The  tumor suppressor gene is recurrently mutated in human cancers and is associated with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) cancer predisposition syndrome.  encodes neurofibromin, a Ras guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling.  mutation accordingly leads to Ras misactivation and downstream activation of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, leading to the approval of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for NF-1 associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) tumors. However, how  loss modifies response to selumetinib and the utility of targeting additional upstream inputs or downstream outputs of Ras these tumors remain unclear. Here, we perform RNA-sequencing, phosphoproteomic, pharmacologic, and proximal proteomic analysis across a panel of CRISPR interference immortalized peripheral nerve (iPN) cells to systematically dissect the function of neurofibromin loss. Small guide  (sg) repression is sufficient to increase Ras GTP levels and alter gene expression to promote cell proliferation and dedifferentiation, with sg iPNs showing decreased sensitivity to selumetinib due to altered feedback regulation to Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK. Upstream small guide  (sg) repression leads to the inverse gene expression signature, decreasing cell proliferation and promoting differentiation, and sg iPNs are more sensitive to selumetinib. However, upstream sonof sevenless 1 inhibition shows limited efficacy in iPNs due to compensation by SOS2. Finally, proximal proteomics reveals Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), but not Harvey rat sarcoma virus (HRAS) or neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), associates with neurofibromin in iPN cells, and pan-KRAS inhibition is sufficient to block ERK activation and CDK1/2 activation in  mutant cells, suggesting blocking KRAS may be a therapeutic approach for  mutant PNS tumors.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brigatinib, a selective ALK inhibitor, demonstrated preclinical activity against a range of crizotinib-resistant ALK alterations in NSCLC. We examined associations between brigatinib efficacy and tumor- and plasma-detected driver mutations in crizotinib-resistant ALK fusion-positive NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissue and plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with crizotinib-exposed ALK-positive NSCLC receiving brigatinib in phase 1/2 and phase 2 ALTA trials were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed by mutation status. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were molecularly profiled at baseline (tumor, 26; ctDNA, 59; 8 with both). Patients received a range of doses, most commonly 90 mg QD. For patients with baseline tumor samples, ORR was 78% (7/9) and median PFS was 11.1 months in patients with secondary ALK mutations co-occurring with ALK fusion, compared with 89% (17/19) and 12.9 months, respectively, in those without ALK mutations. For patients with ctDNA-detectable ALK fusion, ORR was 60% (6/10) and median PFS was 9.2 months in those with secondary ALK mutations, and 50% (10/20) and 21.4 months, respectively, without secondary ALK mutations. The 1 patient with baseline G1202R responded. Six patients had baseline alterations in non-ALK secondary drivers (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MET); none had response. Emergent G1202R was noted in 3 patients and ALK amplification in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Brigatinib showed substantial activity in crizotinib-pretreated ALK-positive NSCLC with ALK-dependent mechanisms of resistance. Patients with non-ALK canonical drivers did not respond to brigatinib, suggesting alternative therapeutic approaches in that cohort.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Activating mutations in AKT genes are rare but play an important role in the commonly dysregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. NCI-MATCH (EAY131) is a tumor agnostic platform trial that enrolled patients to targeted therapies based on matching tumor genomic alterations. Subprotocol Z1K evaluated ipatasertib, a pan-AKT inhibitor, in patients with AKT1E17K mutant metastatic tumors. METHODS: Patients received ipatasertib 400mg, orally once daily in a 28-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with known KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, or BRAF mutations were excluded. Prior PI3K and mTOR inhibitors were allowed. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), 6-month PFS, and toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled, and 29 patients were included in the prespecified primary efficacy analysis. Multiple histologies were enrolled, with breast (n = 18) and gynecologic (n = 7) being the most common. The majority had > 3 lines of therapy (19/29, 65.5%). The ORR was 24.1% (7/29, 90% CI, 11.9%-40.6%) with P < 0.001 against a null rate of 5%. All responses were partial responses. Median response duration was 10.1 months (90% CI, 3.7-10.8). The most common toxicities of any grade included diarrhea (n = 25), nausea (n = 13), and hyperglycemia (n = 9). Grade 3/4 toxicities observed were consistent with reported toxicities for AKT inhibition. Twelve grade 3 events occurred that were thought to be at least possibly related to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The study met its primary endpoint with ipatasertib demonstrating clinically significant activity in heavily pretreated patients with various tumors harboring AKT1E17K mutations.",

OBJECTIVE: Characterize the genotypic and phenotypic landscape of RAS-driven DTC and ATC, and review current and future therapeutic avenues. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review between 1/2015 and 6/2023. Median follow-up duration 8.4 years in DTC cohort, 36.4 months in ATC cohort. SETTING: Single-center study at MD Anderson Cancer Center. PATIENTS: Individuals with RAS-altered DTC or ATC identified before kinase inhibitor exposure. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary objective was to describe clinical and molecular characteristics. Secondary objectives included identifying prognostic factors and assessing survival outcomes with available therapies. RESULTS: Among 120 RAS-driven DTC and 71 RAS-driven ATC, NRAS was the most common alteration (69% of DTC, 70% of ATC), mainly at residue Q61. Brain metastases were found in 22% of patients undergoing brain imaging (19% in DTC, 25% in ATC). Median overall survival (OS) was 15.2 years in DTC, with 49% of patients receiving at least one line of systemic therapy, most commonly lenvatinib (66%). Median time to systemic therapy was 3.5 years from diagnosis, and median OS from therapy initiation was 6.0 years. In ATC, median OS was 7.5 months. Stage IVC (HR=6.78), neck surgery (HR=0.29), and exposure to immunotherapy (HR=0.13) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced RAS-driven follicular-derived thyroid cancers seem to exhibit an aggressive behavior, particularly in ATC, in which prognosis remains poor despite expert multidisciplinary care. Advances in RAS-targeted therapies offer hope for improved therapeutic options.",

Recent findings highlight protein S-nitrosylation, a redox-dependent post-translational modification as a critical modulator of MEK-ERK signaling and immune evasion in this context. In this commentary, we discuss how S-nitrosylation of MAPK components, including MEK and ERK, sustains oncogenic signaling and attenuates immunogenic cell death. Targeting this modification with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors such as L-NAME, L-NMMA and 1400w restore sensitivity of MEK inhibitor, promotes dendritic cell activation, and enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration in preclinical models such as immunogenic mouse models and individual patient derived, primary melanoma cells. We also explore the emerging role of S-nitrosylation in regulating macrophage-mediated immune surveillance and propose translational strategies for combining redox modulation with targeted and immune therapies. These insights offer a compelling framework for overcoming therapeutic resistance and reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment to activate the cytotoxic T-cells and enhance the responses to immunotherapy in NRAS-driven cancers.",

However, its molecular mechanism, especially for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy modulation, remains poorly understood in thyroid cancer (TC). Herein, we conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate the therapeutic effect of APG-115 and the underlying molecular mechanisms in TC. We performed Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8) and cell scratch assay to assess the effect of APG-115 on the biological behavior of TC cells. Meanwhile, we performed animal experiments to investigate the therapeutic effect of APG-115 on TC in vivo. TC patient-derived organoids were further used to evaluate the potential value for clinical application of APG-115. Our results showed that APG-115 exhibited beneficial therapeutic effects in TC both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, APG-115 restored the p53 antitumor effects by blocking MDM2-p53 binding and upregulating the PD-L1 expression. APG-115 downregulated Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 (SLC7A11) expression, contributing to lipid peroxidation and affecting PD-L1 expression in TC. Our study expands the clinical application value of APG-115 in cancer treatment, especially by further exploring the complex interplay between APG-115, PD-L1 immunotherapy, and ferroptosis.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune escape remains a major challenge in cancer immunotherapy. Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNA (tsRNA) represents a novel class of non-coding RNAs generated from tRNA cleavage, regulating gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels. These tsRNAs exhibit diverse biological functions, including immune modulation, metabolic disorders, and cell death. Despite their critical involvement in tumor progression, the role of tsRNAs in Natural killer (NK) cells related to immune escape within colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been revealed yet. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing and the tRFexplorer database were utilized to compare the profiles of CRC and normal tissues. Techniques such as RT-qPCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry were employed to assess gene and protein expression. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, and apoptosis analysis were used to evaluate tumor heterogeneity. Differential gene expression between the tRF-3021a inhibitor and negative control (NC) in HCT116 cells was quantified and characterized using RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 3' tRF-AlaCGC (tRF-3021a) as significantly upregulated in CRC tissues. Major histocompatibility complex class I related chain A (MICA) is an important and stress-induced ligand of the natural killer group 2 member D receptor (NKG2D) that is expressed in various cancer cells. MICA undergoes post-translational modifications that regulate their expression as they are called membrane-bound MICA (mMICA) at the cancer cell surface. mMICA is a ligand that induces the activation of NK cells. Proteolytic cleavage of mMICA by A Disintegrin Metalloproteinase Domains (ADAMs) is the underlying mechanism in CRC. Mechanistically, tRF-3021a promotes proteolytic cleavage of mMICA by upregulating ADAM10, generating soluble MICA (sMICA). Elevated sMICA acts as a decoy ligand for NKG2D receptors on NK cells, impairing cytotoxicity and facilitating immune escape. Functional assays confirmed that tRF-3021a knockdown enhances NK cell-mediated CRC cell killing, while overexpression promotes CRC proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Clinically, tRF-3021a is elevated in CRC tissues, serum exosomes, and cell lines, cleaved by ANG, demonstrating diagnostic potential. , experiments provided further evidence that inhibition of tRF-3021a reduce tumorigenicity. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal tRF-3021a as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by clonal proliferation and accumulation of neoplastic mast cells in one or more organs, most commonly the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and skin. Among its clinical variants, aggressive SM (ASM) presents organ damage and debilitating symptoms due to extensive mast cell infiltration. The management of ASM remains challenging, primarily because treatment must address both symptom control and disease progression. : Recent therapeutic approaches have focused on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the oncogenic  driver mutation, predominantly the D816V mutation, which is implicated in mast cell proliferation. We report a case series of four patients diagnosed with ASM to highlight the real-world experience in the management of ASM. All patients had confirmed  D816V mutations and presented with signs of advanced organ dysfunction, such as marked hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and significant bone marrow infiltration. First-line therapies, including cytoreductive agents or other TKIs were used. Responses varied in these patients, and ultimately, they were initiated on or transitioned to midostaurin, a multikinase TKI. : All four patients, after the initiation of midostaurin, presented clinical and biological improvement-at least a clinical improvement response according to the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment & European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (IWG-MRT-ECNM) criteria. These findings highlight the benefits of KIT inhibition in managing ASM, especially for patients with inadequate responses to traditional therapies. The impact of midostaurin on organ function, mast cell burden, and symptom control emphasizes the importance of the timely integration of TKIs into therapeutic protocols. However, optimal treatment duration, long-term safety, and the development of acquired resistance remain critical questions that warrant further studies. Larger prospective trials are needed to better delineate the prognostic factors associated with sustained response, refine patient selection, and explore combination strategies that may enhance therapeutic efficacy. : The patients presented in this case series benefited from midostaurin therapy, showing either a clinical improvement or partial response according to the IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria. Our case series illustrates that KIT inhibitors can offer meaningful clinical benefit in ASM, reinforcing their position as an emerging cornerstone option in ASM management.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a common and deadly cancer among men and has been the subject of many patients in its diagnosis and treatment. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can slow tumor formation by targeting c-KIT, an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase protein over-expressed in PCa cases. However, Imatinib has no effect on tr-KIT, a truncated form of c-KIT, which is over-expressed in PCa and is associated with neoplastic transformation. In this study, it is aimed to answer whether the anti-proliferative efficacy of Imatinib on PCa cells could be enhanced by inhibition of tr-KIT specific transcription factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: For this purpose, gene expression analysis and cell viability assays were performed in LNCaP prostate cancer cells to investigate the effects of inhibition of transcription factors controlling tr-KIT expression (YY1 and NFYA) in combination with Imatinib administration. As a result, YY1 and NFYA were identified as tr-KIT-specific transcription factors and found that their knockdown increased the effectiveness of Imatinib mesylate treatment on LNCaP cells. The study also analyzed the gene expression changes of c-KIT, FYN, PLC\u03b31, and SAM68 genes and found that SAM68 expression decreased with NFYA and YY1 knockdown, suggesting the existence of other unknown mediators in the tr-KIT pathway. CONCLUSIONS: All in all, this study demonstrates that tr-KIT may be a potential pharmacological target for prostate cancer treatment and that inhibition of the transcription factors YY1 and NFYA may enhance the efficacy of Imatinib. SAM68 was found to be the most affected protein by the treatments, guiding future research.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Quinazolinone derivatives have been documented to exhibit antidiabetic properties via the mechanism of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition. OBJECTIVES: To prepare and investigate the DPP-4 inhibitory activity in vitro and in silico of a series of novel 2-({2-[(dialkylamino)methyl]quinazolin-4-one-3-yl}methyl)benzonitrile derivatives. METHODS: The compounds were synthesized, and the chemical structures were confirmed through spectroscopic techniques. The in vitro DPP-4 inhibitory activity was assessed using an assay kit. Additionally, an in silico study was conducted using molecular docking methods to analyze the occurring binding interactions. RESULTS: The title compounds exhibited good inhibition against DPP-4 enzyme activity (IC: 1.4621 to 6.7805 \u00b5M). Among the compounds studied, the compound having morpholino-methyl substituted at C-2 (5d) exhibited the highest potency in DPP-4 inhibitory activity. Their activities were lower than sitagliptin as the reference standard with IC: 0.0236 \u00b5M and lead compound. In the in silico study, the compounds bound against the DPP-4 enzyme, with affinity values similar to those of sitagliptin. However, only compound 5f showed an interaction orientation and amino acid residues that were somewhat similar to those observed in the interaction between the DPP-4 enzyme and sitagliptin, as well as in the interaction between the DPP-4 enzyme and the lead compound. CONCLUSIONS: A series of novel 2-({2-[(dialkylamino)methyl]quinazolin-4-one-3-yl}methyl)benzonitrile derivatives have been synthesized successfully. All the synthesized compounds had lower DPP-4 inhibitory activity than sitagliptin and the lead compound. The lower bioactivity was predicted due to the differences in the interaction between the synthesized and lead compounds against the DPP-4 enzyme.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the role and mechanism of miR-122-5p in the process of fracture healing following a Pilon fracture, as well as to further assess the clinical significance of this molecule as a potential diagnostic marker for fracture nonunion. METHODS: The expression levels of miR-122-5p were examined in patients with Pilon fracture healed and nonunion, respectively. ROC analysis was employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-122-5p in identifying fracture nonunion, while logistic regression identified its risk factors. The effects of miR-122-5p on the proliferation, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation markers of osteoblasts were analyzed by CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, and ALP assay kit. Additionally, DLR and RIP assays validated miR-122-5p targeting PDCD4. RESULTS: Serum miR-122-5p was significantly under-expressed in patients with fracture nonunion, whereas PDCD4 exhibits a notable over-expressed. Serum miR-122-5p can predict non-union of fractures, with a sensitivity of 90.82% and a specificity of 78.33%. Low miR-122-5p expression is a potential risk factor for fracture nonunion. The overexpression of miR-122-5p enhanced the proliferation ability of osteoblasts, inhibited cell apoptosis, and upregulated the expressions of ALP, OCN, and RUNX2; knockdown of miR-122-5p elicits opposite effect. PDCD4 is a direct target of miR-122-5p. The osteoblast dysfunction induced by miR-122-5p inhibitors can be reversed by down-regulating PDCD4. CONCLUSION: Diminished miR-122-5p emerge as a potential prognostic indicator for nonunion in Pilon fractures. miR-122-5p accelerates the healing of Pilon fractures by targeting and inhibiting PDCD4.",

          "abstract": "Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) is a pivotal mediator of toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling, critically involved in innate immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Dysregulated IRAK4 activity contributes to chronic inflammation in both immune and non-immune cells. In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory potential of a selective IRAK4 inhibitor on monosodium urate (MSU) crystals-stimulated macrophages and xanthine-challenged HepG2 cells to assess its therapeutic potential.  Human PBMCs were pretreated with 1 \u00b5M IRAK4 inhibitor (IRAK4i) overnight, followed by stimulation with 100 \u00b5g/ml MSU for either 30 minutes or 24 hours. Conditioned medium was collected for ELISA and RNA for qPCR to quantify pro- and anti-inflammatory factors. Cell lysates were prepared to analyze various TLR/IL-1\u03b2 signaling proteins, including phosphorylated IRAK4, P38, ERK, and JNK. Phagocytosis was assessed using a Vybrant\u2122 phagocytosis assay kit in PBMCs. We also utilize HepG2 cells and pretreated with 1 \u00b5M IRAK4 inhibitor (IRAK4i) overnight, followed by stimulation with 2.5mM of xanthine for 24 hours to assess the expression of cytokine and xanthine oxidoreductase.  Primary macrophages and HepG2 cells were treated with a potent IRAK4 inhibitor in the presence and absence of MSU or xanthine. In macrophages, IRAK4 inhibition significantly reduced the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 at both mRNA and protein levels, while promoting polarization toward an anti-inflammatory (M2-like) phenotype alongside reduced activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways. In HepG2 cells, IRAK4 blockade attenuated xanthine-induced expression of xanthine dehydrogenase and inflammatory cytokines.  These findings demonstrate the dual anti-inflammatory effect of IRAK4 inhibition in both immune and hepatic cells and suggest a promising strategy to mitigate inflammation in gout.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the modulatory effect of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) protein in the Notch1 signaling pathway in cervical cancer (CC) cells and assess how this modulation affects the proliferation and migration of CC cells. Moreover, this study offers fresh perspectives on the molecular mechanisms underlying CC by thoroughly analyzing the relationship between 15-PGDH and the Notch1 signaling pathway, and investigates the therapeutic potential of 15-PGDH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human normal cervical epithelial cells and CC cell lines (human CC cell line [HeLa], human cervical squamous carcinoma cell line [Caski], and human cervical epidermoid carcinoma cells [ME180]) were selected as experimental models. Western blotting (WB) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed to evaluate the protein and messenger RNA levels of 15-PGDH and Notch receptor 1 (Notch1) signaling pathway-related proteins (Jagged canonical Notch ligand 1 [Jagged1] and Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1 [Hes1]). Results suggested that the HeLa and Caski cells exhibited significant expression of 15-PGDH and Notch1 signaling-related proteins. A series of experiments, including WB, cell counting kit-8 assay, Transwell migration assay, and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, was conducted in the HeLa and Caski cells to obtain an extensive understanding of how 15-PGDH influences Notch1 signaling regulation. This study also utilized the 15-PGDH inhibitor SW033291 and a Notch1 overexpression vector to evaluate the effect of 15-PGDH on CC cell growth, motility, and Notch1 signaling pathway modulation. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that in the normal human cervical epithelial cells, 15-PGDH was highly expressed, while the Notch1 signaling pathway-related proteins exhibited low expression quantities. However, in HeLa and Caski CC cells, 15-PGDH expression was significantly downregulated ( < 0.001 or  < 0.01), whereas the Notch1 signaling pathway was activated. Further studies revealed that 15-PGDH or its inhibitor influenced the stimulation of the Notch1 signaling pathway in the HeLa and Caski cells. Specifically, the 15-PGDH inhibitor SW033291 reduced 15-PGDH expression ( < 0.001 or  < 0.01) and promoted Notch signaling activation. Meanwhile, 15-PGDH upregulation suppressed Notch signaling activation. Furthermore, 15-PGDH successfully prevented the proliferation and migration of CC cells induced by Notch1 overexpression and reduced the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, as shown by the downregulation of Notch1 and its downstream effectors, Jagged1 and Hes1. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the role of 15-PGDH in regulating the Notch1 signaling pathway in CC cells, focusing on its effect on cell proliferation and migration. The results demonstrate that 15-PGDH suppresses CC cell proliferation and migration by downregulating the Notch1 signaling pathway. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CC and suggest 15-PGDH as a promising therapeutic target.",

It is aimed to elucidate the role of ROCK in the regulation of PI3K signaling inhibited by PTEN and to evaluate the effects of ROCK inhibitors Thiazovivin and GSK 429286 on glioblastoma as a new therapeutic strategy. U87 MG and L929 cell lines were used to research the cytotoxic effect of ROCK inhibitors Thiazovivin and GSK 429286. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method and xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer were used to determine its effect on cell viability. To assess the impact of ROCK inhibitors on PTEN protein levels, PTEN expression in cell lysates was quantitatively determined in vitro using the PTEN ELISA Kit. Total protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit, p-Akt and PTEN protein level was determined by the western blot method. Showed that GSK 429286 and Thiazovivin significantly reduced U87 MG cell viability even at low concentrations. When IC values were examined, it was understood that THV (IC: 11.02\u00a0\u00b5M) showed a more potent cytotoxic effect at lower concentrations compared to GSK 429286 (IC: 89.58\u00a0\u00b5M). At 50\u00a0\u00b5M, Thiazovivin and GSK 429286 concentration caused a significant increase in PTEN activity compared to the control and Temozolomide groups, even at low concentrations. THV 50\u00a0\u03bcM significantly increased PTEN expression compared to control (p\u2009<\u20090.05). GSK 50\u00a0\u03bcM, THV 1\u00a0\u03bcM, and THV 10\u00a0\u03bcM groups showed significantly reduced p-Akt expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Considering the effects on healthy cells, Thiazovivin being more effective at low doses suggests it may be a more selective agent. Our findings indicate that ROCK inhibitors may have cytotoxic effects on glioblastoma cells by affecting cell death mechanisms via a PTEN-associated reduction in PI3K/AKT signaling.",

METHODOLOGY: This prospective observational study was conducted at Obstetrics Intensive Care Unit. Blood and urine samples were taken from critically sick obstetric patients on the day of admission, and the second urine sample was taken after 48 hours. Following admission, the APACHE 2 score was determined. According to the manufacturer's instructions, an ELISA kit was used to perform the final estimation of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]. AKI was diagnosed and staged as per KDIGO 2012 guidelines. RESULTS: At the time of admission, AKI was not present in any of the 131 critically ill obstetric patients who met the study's inclusion requirements. Only 127 out of the 131 patients were analysed, four patients were excluded, 3 patients died within 48 hours, and 1 patient left against medical advice. Pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders accounted for the majority of AKI as risk factors (57.1%), followed by haemorrhage (48.1%), which included abruption in 19.5%, placenta previa/accreta/percreta (10.4%), and PPH (14.3%).Patients who developed AKI had a substantially higher mean [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] on the day of admission (3.47\u00b13.66 (ng/ml)/1000) than those who did not (0.22\u00b10.12 ng/ml)/1000). ROC curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels on Day 1. [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] exhibited a sensitivity of 94.8% and specificity of 94% for predicting AKI at a cutoff value of \u22650.41(ng/ml)/1000, with a 95% confidence interval and an AUC of 0.990. CONCLUSION: Patient risk of developing AKI was accurately predicted by the urine biomarker [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]. It also has good prognostic value.",

          "abstract": "Platinum-based and pyrimidine drugs are first-line treatments for gastric cancer (GC), but their efficacy is often affected by drug resistance. High spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4) expression is associated with poor prognosis, but its role in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance is not yet clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of SALL4 on 5-FU resistance in GC cells by bioinformatics analysis, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, cell counting kit-8, colony formation assay, and western blot. The results showed that SALL4 was highly expressed in GC and significantly correlated with the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway. Knockdown of SALL4 resulted in a notable attenuation of cellular proliferative capacity and heightened susceptibility to 5-FU resistance in GC cells, while overexpression of SALL4 enhanced 5-FU resistance. Rescue assays confirmed that SALL4 fostered 5-FU resistance in GC cells by enhancing FAO. Our research confirmed that SALL4 promoted the resistance of GC cells to 5-FU by enhancing the FAO pathway. This suggests that drug development targeting SALL4 may help overcome chemotherapy resistance in GC.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common subtype of primary liver cancer, remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Although 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone (HMA), a natural anthraquinone compound, has demonstrated antitumor activity in various malignancies, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in HCC are not fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effects and molecular mechanisms of HMA in HCC. Human HCC cell lines were treated with HMA, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. A heterotopic xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice to evaluate in\u00a0vivo tumor growth and weight. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to assess tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to predict potential targets of HMA in HCC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to evaluate mRNA and protein expression levels. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using wound healing and transwell assays. Our data revealed that HMA significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and inhibited migration and invasion in both HCC cells and tumor tissues. Mechanistically, HMA downregulated Annexin A5 (ANXA5) expression and inhibited activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. Silencing of ANXA5 replicated the inhibitory effects of HMA and further enhanced its pro-apoptotic and anti-invasive activities. Conversely, overexpression of ANXA5 restored PI3K/AKT signaling activity and reversed the inhibitory effects of HMA on HepG2 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These reversal effects were abolished by treatment with LY294002, a selective PI3K inhibitor. In summary, HMA suppresses the progression of HCC by targeting ANXA5 and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic agent for HCC.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors poses an ongoing clinical challenge. We investigated molecularly matched combination therapies for treatment-refractory GIST, including drugs not previously combined in human studies. METHODS: Patients of all ages with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST treated with combination therapies were included (February 13, 2015-December 31, 2022). These patients were discussed at molecular tumor board and enrolled in the prospective Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (I-PREDICT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02534675). Patient demographics, tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS), treatment responses, and survival outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Six (1.6%) patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 59.5 years with the majority (4/6) of patients being male. NGS revealed median of six deleterious genomic alterations per patient excluding variants of unknown significance. Five (5/6) patients had -mutant GIST, and one patient had -mutant GIST. Two thirds of tumors had  loss. Patients received median of 1 (range, 1-3) customized combination therapy consisting of median of 2 (range, 2-3) drugs targeting median of 2 (range, 2-4) genomic alterations. One patient experienced a treatment-related grade \u22653 adverse event (hypertension). For all patients, the best response by RECIST v1.1 was stable disease (SD). Combination therapies led to SD \u22656 months (range, 6.2-11.3 months) in four (4/6) patients compared with none in the immediate previous single-agent targeted therapies (SD range, 1.5-5.4 months). Most (5/6) patients had at least 60% prolongation of their progression-free survival compared with their immediate previous single-agent targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a multitargeted, biomarker-matched combination approach can be safely administered to obtain disease control. Tailored combination therapies for advanced GIST with multiple genomic alterations warrant further investigation.",

          "title": "Clinical impact of primary and secondary KIT mutations on the efficacy of molecular-targeted therapies in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are commonly driven by primary mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Imatinib is the first-line therapy for GISTs. However, secondary mutations frequently emerge during imatinib treatment, contributing to resistance and influencing the efficacy of subsequent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib and regorafenib. This study aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of both primary and secondary KIT mutations in treating and prognosing unresectable or recurrent GISTs. METHODS: Ninety patients with unresectable or recurrent GISTs treated at our institution between 2000 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Genetic testing was performed before the initial drug administration to guide first-line imatinib therapy based on the primary mutation profile. In 64 imatinib-resistant patients, additional genetic testing was conducted on tissues obtained from resistant lesions. Treatment response and prognosis were compared across mutational profiles. RESULTS: The most common primary mutation was KIT exon 11 (76.7%), followed by exon 9 (12.2%). Patients with exon 9 mutations showed superior progression-free survival with sunitinib than those with exon 11 mutations. Among patients with exon 11 primary mutations, secondary mutations were identified in 79.2%, predominantly in KIT exon 13/14 (47.9%) or 17/18 (31.3%). Sunitinib was more effective in patients with secondary exon 13/14 mutations, whereas regorafenib was significantly more effective in those with exon 17/18 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary KIT mutations play a crucial role in imatinib resistance and the efficacy of second- and third-line therapies. Genetic profiling at the initial diagnosis and at the time of resistance may provide more personalized and effective treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Molecular events that drive endometriosis (EM) and cause accompanying immune deregulation remain elusive. Our purpose was to identify key pathways involved in lesion formation across diverse populations and to detect transcriptomic changes in eutopic endometrium that accompany EM. METHODS: We searched Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress and performed differential gene expression analysis and a network meta-analysis on nine qualifying datasets. Those contained transcriptomic data on 114 ectopic endometrium samples (EL), 138 eutopic endometrium samples from women with endometriosis (EEM), and 79 eutopic endometrium samples from women without endometriosis (EH). Gene ontology and enrichment analysis were performed in DAVID, Metascape, and Cytoscape, and drug repurposing was done in CMap. RESULTS: EEM compared to EH upregulated  and downregulated , , and  genes (|logFC| > 0.5,  < 0.05). EL showed increased expression of complement and serpin genes (EL vs. EEM: , logFC = 3.38,  < 0.0001; , logFC = 2.40,  < 0.0001; , logFC = 1.02,  < 0.05; , logFC = 1.54,  < 0.001) and mast cell markers (EL vs. EEM: , logFC = 1.54,  < 0.0001; , logFC = 0.74,  < 0.001). Functional enrichment analysis highlighted complement and coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling as drivers of endometriosis. Pharmacogenomic analysis indicated Janus kinase (JAK), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), and topoisomerase inhibitors as therapy targets. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an interplay between complement and coagulation, mast cells, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the JAK/STAT3 pathway in endometriosis. We underscore the significance of complement C3 and propose JAK inhibitors as therapy candidates. Detected expression differences between EEM and EH are important for the development of diagnosis via endometrial biopsy.",

          "abstract": "CircRNAs can be applied as tumor biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the function of circ_PSD3 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has not been thoroughly explored. The current project attempts to analyze it. RT-qPCR was adopted for measuring the expression of circ_PSD3, HMGB3, miR-145-5p as well as miR-338-3p in PTC tissues and cells. Through performing cell counting kit-8 and transwell experiments, the biological effects of circ_PSD3, HMGB3, miR-145-5p and miR-338-3p on PTC cells were detected. Besides, a dual-luciferase reporter gene was employed to identify the underlying mechanism of circ_PSD3. The Western blot analysis assay was utilized to assess the expression levels of molecular marker proteins associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. According to the results, the expressions of circ_PSD3 and HMGB3 showed obvious upregulation in PTC tissues, whereas knockdown of circ_PSD3 or HMGB3 notably hindered cell proliferation, migration as well as invasion in PTC. Mechanistically, it could be discovered that miR-145-5p and miR-338-3p served as the targets of circ_PSD3, and HMGB3 was a target of miR-145-5p and miR-338-3p. Moreover, miR-145-5p and miR-338-3p were discovered to play the role of tumor suppressors in PTC. More importantly, the findings showed that cell proliferation, migration, invasion together with EMT processes were attenuated by circ_PSD3 knockdown, but partially counteracted by miR-338-3p (miR-145-5p) inhibitor or HMGB3 overexpression. Based on the obtained data, circ_PSD3 promotes PTC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT by regulating the miR-145-5p/miR-338-3p/HMGB3 axis. The current work revealed the mechanism of action of circ_PSD3 in PTC and may play the role of a new medical target for PTC.",

          "title": "Sunitinib and TB lymphadenitis: An unexpected link in oncological therapy: a case report.",
          "abstract": "RATIONALE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are neoplasms that originate from the interstitial cells of cajal located in the muscular layer of the gastrointestinal tract. Surgery is the primary treatment options; however, if resection is not feasible, or in cases of metastatic or recurrent GIST, systemic chemotherapy can be considered as an alternative. Sunitinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is indicated as an essential second-line treatment for GIST following disease progression or intolerance to imatinib mesylate. It works by slowing down or stopping the growth of tumor cells through the inhibiting tyrosine kinases, including KIT and PDGFR\u03b1. Commonly reported side effects of sunitinib include hypertension, fatigue, neutropenia, and dermatologic reactions such as rash. PATIENT CONCERNS: A patient diagnosed with relapsed malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) was treated with sunitinib for 15 months following the failure of imatinib treatment. The patient presented with neck pain and a fever of up to 38.8\u00b0C. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: Upon evaluation, a palpable lymph node was biopsied, and pathology results confirmed tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis. Subsequently, TB medication was initiated, and 2 months after starting the treatment, significant improvement in lymphadenopathy was observed on the computed tomography scan. However, the patient experienced side effects during the treatment, including hepatotoxicity, visual disturbances, and a decreased platelet count, which led to discontinuation and a change in medication. OUTCOMES: The treatment lasted for a year, which was longer than that initially planned. Despite switching to third-line therapy for GIST, the disease progressed, and the patient eventually died. LESSONS: Owing to the anti-angiogenic effect of sunitinb, infectious complications are very rare, and cases of tuberculosis-related side effects associated with sunitinib are almost unheard of. This case illustrates that TB lymphadenitis can occur as a rare adverse effect of sunitinib treatment.",

          "abstract": "Over half of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients suffer from gastrointestinal motility disorders. miR-365-3p is involved in DM progression, but its role in gastrointestinal motility disorders remains unclear. This study explored whether miR-365-3p affects gastrointestinal motility in diabetic rats via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway. A DM rat model was established using a high-fat, high-sugar diet and injected with a miR-365-3p mimic/inhibitor. DM symptoms, gastric emptying, intestinal propulsion rates, and gastrointestinal transit time were assessed. HE and TUNEL staining evaluated gastrointestinal pathology and apoptosis. qRT-PCR detected miR-365-3p levels, while ELISA assessed gastrointestinal motility-related factors. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyzed C-kit, TLR4, and pathway proteins. DM rats exhibited increased body weight, blood glucose, and glucose intolerance, with reduced fasting insulin, confirming successful modeling. miR-365-3p was downregulated in DM rats. Injection of miR-365-3p mimic alleviated DM symptoms, reduced gastrointestinal tissue damage and apoptosis, and improved motility. The TLR4 agonist CRX-527 impaired these effects. In conclusion, miR-365-3p overexpression alleviates DM symptoms, gastrointestinal injury, and motility disorders by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway, offering a potential therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a complex and highly heterogeneous malignancy marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which facilitates immune evasion and disease progression. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key immune checkpoint molecule expressed on tumor and immune cells, whose activation allows tumors to evade immune surveillance, plays a central role in modulating antitumor immunity in RCC. While the transcriptional and cytokine-mediated regulation of PD-L1 is well documented, emerging evidence emphasizes the critical influence of post-translational modifications particularly ubiquitination and deubiquitination in controlling PD-L1 stability and function. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), highlighting the roles of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs) in modulating PD-L1 expression and their broader implications in RCC tumor biology. We further discuss how these proteins influence immune cell infiltration, tumor progression, and response to immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of targeting UPS components, including proteasome inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras, is also explored. Understanding the UPS-mediated regulation of PD-L1 offers promising avenues for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy in RCC.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases, is the most prevalent form. Treatment options for NSCLC include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapies. Among these, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have demonstrated significant potential, particularly in improving treatment outcomes. However, their clinical efficacy is impeded by challenges such as toxicity, resistance development, and variable patient responses. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut microbiome as an important modulator of immune responses in NSCLC, particularly in the context of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Specific gut microbes, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, have been associated with improved responses to immunotherapy, suggesting that modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance treatment outcomes. This review discusses the current understanding of the influence of gut microbiome on NSCLC and its potential to improve the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. By integrating microbiome-based insights into personalized treatment strategies, we can overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy approaches and optimize patient outcomes. This review aims to serve as a resource for the scientific community by providing insights into how modulation of gut microbiome may enhance treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary liver malignancy, have historically been limited, particularly in unresectable cases with underlying cirrhosis. Initial systemic therapy with antiangiogenic agents, notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as sorafenib, showed modest survival gains but lacked durable responses. Subsequent trials with more potent VEGF pathway inhibitors failed to improve overall survival significantly, raising concerns about the long-term utility and potential hepatic and renal toxicities of prolonged VEGF blockade. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) marked a paradigm shift. Trial results demonstrating that dual-ICI regimens induced more durable responses and achieved higher long-term survival rates have challenged the prior VEGF-centric therapeutic approach and suggest that early use of dual ICIs may offer a more transformative effect on disease trajectory. Although anti-VEGF therapies remain valuable for initial tumor shrinkage, prolonged use may compromise liver regeneration and worsen portal hypertension. A refined treatment strategy emphasizing VEGF inhibition for a limited duration followed by or combined with ICIs may optimize both efficacy and safety. Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for ICI response and on developing regimens that maximize long-term survival in unresectable HCC.",

          "abstract": "Current response evaluation methods have accuracy limitations. Monitoring with a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation-based tumor fraction (TF) may provide a more accurate assessment of tumor burden across solid tumors. In this study, we evaluate a tissue-free, methylation-based TF and explore the association with treatment outcomes in RADIOHEAD, a cohort of 1,070 patients with solid tumors receiving standard of care (SoC) ICI regimens, with blood samples collected prospectively for retrospective analysis. 1,997 baseline and serial on-treatment plasma samples from 627 patients with stage IV cancer were analyzed with an analytically validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) methylation-based ctDNA assay (Guardant Reveal). The primary outcome measure was real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). Secondary outcomes included real-world overall survival (rwOS) and the lead time between non-molecular response (nMR) to rwPFS event. Patients with any decrease in TF while receiving ICI had superior outcomes. Patients with >80% decrease in TF at two timepoints or TF below the limit of quantification (LOQ) had longer rwPFS and rwOS than those with <80% decrease (nMR) (rwPFS HR 0.24 [95% CI 0.19, 0.32] p<0.005; rwOS HR 0.28 [95% CI 0.21, 0.38] p<0.005). nMR was detected prior to clinical progression in 209 patients with a median lead time of 3.03 months. Among 627 stage IV cancer patients receiving SoC ICI, monitoring with methylation-based TF identified patients who have significantly longer rwPFS and rwOS. Changes in TF on ICI can provide additional response data earlier than imaging alone and support the potential of serial monitoring to inform treatment decisions.",

This study evaluates the efficacy and mechanism of local radiotherapy combined with PD 1/PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic triple negative breast cancer treatment. A retrospective analysis of 40 patients divided into a combination group (local radiotherapy + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) and a single-agent group (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) was conducted. Clinical efficacy, progression-free survival, immune cytokine levels (Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-8), and adverse effects were compared. Results showed that the combination therapy significantly improved clinical outcomes and prolonged progression-free survival without increasing toxicity. Patients receiving local radiotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibited reduced immune cytokines, with no significant post-treatment increase in Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-8 levels. These findings suggest that local radiotherapy enhances the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in TNBC treatment without raising the risk of adverse effects.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), represented by atezolizumab and durvalumab, have shown encouraging therapeutic effects in the combination chemotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and have become preferred regimens. It has marked a seminal shift in the treatment landscape with achieving for the first time that overall survival exceed 1\u2009year. However, the extent to which SCLC patients can benefit from ICIs is limited, and ICIs' combination treatment strategies still need to be continuously explored. Beyond the ICIs in combination with radiotherapy, the anti-angiogenic target has been a combination option to improve effectiveness. And the novel formula of immune drugs, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific T cell engager therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy, also promotes the potential option for SCLC patients. Based on the molecular development and biomarkers analysis of the sensitivity to immune checkpoint of the SCLC subtypes, the exploration of new targets and the development of drugs with novel mechanisms may provide fresh hope for immunotherapy in SCLC.",

Large, phase III registrational trials of ICI-containing regimens in resectable and embolization-eligible settings are now reading out. This review summarizes and critically appraises efficacy and safety data from these studies with consideration of the optimal use of ICIs in conjunction with antiangiogenic agents including important issues in management of HCC across the continuum of care such as those related to patient selection, treatment sequencing, and liver preservation. IMbrave050 assessed atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in resected HCC and EMERALD-1 and LEAP-012 evaluated addition of durvalumab-bevacizumab and pembrolizumab-lenvatinib to transarterial chemoembolization in unresectable, embolization-eligible HCC. Both EMERALD-1 and LEAP-012 met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. While IMbrave050 initially met its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival, the adjuvant atezolizumab-bevacizumab benefit was not maintained in an updated analysis. Survival benefits remain unclear for all phase III trials. Safety outcomes can be generally described as predictable based on experience with the respective experimental regimens in the advanced setting. Treatment selection in embolization-eligible settings should consider risks and benefits with special consideration of liver preservation.

For  wild-type ATC and without other actionable alterations, the most promising strategy is certainly immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown activities both in monotherapy or in combination regimens. However, access to novel treatments is heterogeneous worldwide for ATC patients, and activity of immunotherapy as a single agent is limited. We report the case of a patient with locally advanced  wild-type ATC who achieved a near-complete and durable response following a multimodal treatment approach combining chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), and external beam radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was continued as maintenance therapy, and disease control was maintained for over 1 year. This case highlights the potential efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in  wild-type ATC, especially when a rapid tumor reduction is required. It supports the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with cytotoxic agents as a viable therapeutic option in this aggressive tumor subtype.",

          "abstract": "The most malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), has a high mortality rate. Recently, translational elements in GBM therapy have emerged as novel therapeutic strategies in addition to conventional treatment methods. In this way, Toll-like receptor (TLR), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NOTCH, and other signaling pathways have recently become some of the main signaling pathways in brain tumors. The immunological reactions to brain tumors are mediated by these mechanisms. A family of proteins known as TLRs is essential to the natural defense mechanism because it can identify and react to infections and other danger signals. TLRs have dual functions in the glioma microenvironment including that they can initially activate the innate and adaptive immune responses that support antitumor activity and secondly, their activation can also contribute to tumor progression by promoting inflammation and immune evasion, as they are expressed on both immune cells and tumor cells. TLR agonists are receiving more attention in the treatment of glioma because some of them have demonstrated survival benefits in clinical studies when used in conjunction with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The most exciting use of TLR agonists is that they can be used as immunomodulators to avoid dose accumulation, boost the efficiency of other therapies, and, by upregulating PD-1, reinforce delayed immune checkpoint resistance against PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. Therefore, the use of TLR agonists can lead to PD-L1 overexpression, which in turn enhances the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and triggers potent anticancer immune responses. In this article, we describe the function of the TLR signaling system, the cellular and molecular elements contributing to the etiology of glioblastoma multiforme, the connection between TLRs and glioma, and their significance for immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare hematological syndrome presenting with massive, dysregulated cytokine release that can result in multiple organ failure and is associated with a high risk of mortality. Based on the recent North American consortium recommendations, it has been suggested to categorize HLH into two entities, HLH syndrome and HLH disease. HLH disease encompasses multiple subgroups, including familial HLH (F-HLH), HLH-associated immune compromise (IC-HLH) and HLH observed after immune activating therapies. The diagnosis can be quite challenging, and the pathophysiology leading to HLH disease has yet to be fully elucidated. Much less is known about HLH that occurs due to treatment with immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Herein, the authors report a case of a 71-year-old man who was treated with a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for bladder cancer. He later presented with mental status changes and pancytopenia, ultimately meeting the diagnostic criteria for HLH syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Pseudoprogression is an atypical response pattern to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), characterized by initial tumor enlargement or the appearance of new lesions, followed by subsequent tumor regression. While this phenomenon has been observed in several solid tumors, its occurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare and not well understood, presenting diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the first female case of HCC pseudoprogression during atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B-related advanced HCC. After multiple prior treatments, she was started on combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Following four treatment cycles, imaging revealed tumor enlargement and new small lesions, suggestive of disease progression. However, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level had decreased from 45,598 ng/mL to 23,719 ng/mL, and there was no clinical deterioration. Based on these findings, treatment was continued. Imaging after eight and 12 cycles demonstrated marked tumor regression and the normalization of AFP (<2 ng/mL), confirming a diagnosis of pseudoprogression. Although uncommon, pseudoprogression should be considered during ICI therapy for HCC. The accurate interpretation of radiologic findings in conjunction with clinical status and tumor markers is essential to avoid the premature discontinuation of potentially effective treatments. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, predictive markers, and clinical significance of pseudoprogression in HCC.",

Despite treatment with prednisolone, infliximab, and vedolizumab, the patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in hypoalbuminemia and unfeasibility of surgical intervention. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels served as a critical diagnostic clue, prompting abdominal radiography, which subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of toxic megacolon. This case highlights a rare but life-threatening complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors and underscores the challenges in managing refractory immune-related colitis.

          "abstract": "Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. The treatment landscape of gastrointestinal cancer has entered a new era with the advent of immunotherapy, which activates the immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells. Immunotherapy has demonstrated high efficacy and tolerable toxicity profiles compared to conventional therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 in combination with targeted therapy or chemotherapy have been approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors with good clinical patient benefit. In recent years, a variety of novel immunotherapeutic approaches have emerged. For example, adoptive T-cell therapy, such as claudin18.2-targeted CAR-T has achieved an objective remission rate of 48.6% in patients with advanced gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Oncolytic viruses inhibits tumor growth in both tumor lysis and immune activation, and is currently showing its efficacy against gastrointestinal tumors in some clinical trials. In addition, cancer vaccines, with their unique high degree of precision, have improved the effectiveness of individualized therapy. Personalized neoantigen vaccines combined with other immunotherapeutic drugs or chemotherapy, have shown some efficacy and safety in gastrointestinal patients. In this review, we summarize these recent advances in immunotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Additionally, the challenges and limitations linked to immunotherapy were explored. This review will expand our understanding of clinical studies on immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer and assist in individualizing patient treatment strategies, maximizing therapeutic benefits, and improving patient prognosis.",

          "abstract": "Liver metastasis is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Functional modulation of Kupffer cells (KCs) holds promise as an alternative immunotherapeutic approach. Leveraging their capacity to capture circulating virions, an oncolytic virus-based KC-targeting strategy is developed that demonstrated efficacy and safety in treating multifocal liver metastasis. A single intravenous infusion of the M51R mutant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-M51R), but not wild-type (WT) VSV, induced significant tumor regression in mouse models of forced liver metastasis, independent of direct oncolysis. The ineffectiveness of VSV-WT is attributed to its induction of massive KC apoptosis, whereas VSV-M51R replicated transiently within KCs without compromising viability. Instead, VSV-M51R promoted KC proliferation in tumor-adjacent areas, enhancing their access to tumor foci and cross-presentation of tumor antigens. This led to robust activation of hepatic anti-tumor CD8 T-cell responses, which required mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-dependent type I interferon triggering in KCs. Depletion of KCs abolished the T cell stimulating and anti-tumor effects of VSV-M51R. Furthermore, simultaneous blockade of programmed cell death-ligand 1(PD-L1) during VSV-M51R treatment achieved remarkable synergistic efficacy in treating monotherapy-resistant late-stage liver metastasis. These findings underscore the pivotal role of KCs in systemic oncolytic virotherapy and offer a potentially applicable strategy for treating advanced liver metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapy has demonstrated potential in treating various malignant tumors, but its efficacy in pancreatic cancer (PC) remains limited, possibly due to the dense stromal components and immunosuppressive microenvironment of PC. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular signaling pathways. However, the specific role of FAK in the development and progression of PC, as well as its regulatory mechanisms on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM), are still not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed single-cell sequencing datasets and clinical specimens to evaluate the role of FAK in the immune response of PC. We verified the impact of FAK alterations on CD8 T cell infiltration using a co-culture system of patient-derived organoids (PDO) and immune cells. Additionally, mouse PC models and dual humanized models are established to investigate the in vivo function of FAK and the potential of its inhibitors for immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that FAK is associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment in PC. Inhibiting FAK enhances CD8 T cell infiltration by promoting CXCL10\u00a0secretion in PC. Moreover, FAK inhibitors exhibit a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study explores the potential of FAK as a therapeutic target, particularly its role in modulating TIM, thereby providing new research directions for the treatment of PC.",

          "abstract": "Oncolytic immunotherapy, particularly using engineered adenoviruses, has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment due to its dual mechanism of action: selective tumor-cell destruction and inducing potent antitumor immune responses. This review focuses on the immunological effects observed in clinical trials involving conditionally replicating oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds), either with or without transgenes. These viruses primarily exert antitumor effects through mechanisms like direct oncolysis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy, while also activating innate and adaptive immune responses. Different genetic modification strategies have been employed to enhance the safety and therapeutic efficacy of OAds. However, these alterations may influence viral replication dynamics, oncolytic potency, and the duration of viral presence (i.e., persistence) within the tumor. Clinical data have shown that OAds can also profoundly alter the tumor microenvironment (TME), converting cold tumors to hot by increasing immune cell infiltration and activation. This conversion not only correlates with improved clinical outcomes but also creates conditions conducive to the efficacy of other immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which traditionally show limited activity in cold tumors. The synergistic potential of combining OAds with ICIs has shown promising results in improving clinical response rates. However, maximizing therapeutic benefit requires careful consideration of the OAd's immune-activating capabilities and optimal timing of combination strategies. This review provides critical insights into the current state of OAd-based immunotherapy, examining its role in modulating the TME, while addressing the complex interplay between oncolytic activity and sustained immune stimulation in clinical practice.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or durvalumab combined with chemotherapy show promise. However, those immune checkpoint inhibitors are very expensive. Tislelizumab may offer a more affordable alternative for advanced GBC. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report on the case of a 70-year-old patient with GBC who, after experiencing disease progression following standard second-line chemotherapy, was excluded from participating in a clinical trial due to poor performance status. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with stage IVB (TxN2M0) GBC. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with tislelizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. OUTCOMES: The patient had a progression-free survival of 7 months and overall survival of 16 months. The overall overall survival from the onset of the disease was 23 months. LESSONS: The administration of tislelizumab improved survival in a patient with advanced gallbladder cancer. Tislelizumab emerged as a potential more cost-effective alternative option to pembrolizumab or durvalumab in our treatment strategy. These findings provide the basis for large-scale clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of tislelizumab for GBC.",

          "abstract": "RATIONALE: Penile metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an extremely rare clinical entity, particularly in the era of immune-checkpoint inhibitor and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor combination therapy. The mechanisms, clinical presentation, and optimal management of such cases remain poorly understood. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 75-year-old man with metastatic RCC undergoing systemic therapy developed persistent, painful erections (malignant priapism), along with urinary retention, general malaise, and back pain, 2 years after initiating treatment. DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the penis revealed a hypointense lesion on T2-weighted imaging and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging, suggestive of tumor infiltration into the corpus cavernosum. Blood gas analysis from corporal aspiration was consistent with nonischemic priapism. A diagnosis of penile metastasis from RCC was established. INTERVENTIONS: Embolization of the common penile artery was performed, followed by palliative radiotherapy (30 gray in 10 fractions). OUTCOMES: Despite these interventions, penile rigidity persisted, though partial symptomatic relief and pain reduction were achieved. Disease progression was noted, and the patient died approximately 3 months after the diagnosis of penile metastasis. LESSONS: This is the first reported case of penile metastasis from RCC during immune-checkpoint inhibitor-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy, highlighting a rare but clinically important metastatic pattern potentially unmasked by prolonged survival. Retrograde dissemination via Batson venous plexus may underlie this presentation. Radiotherapy and embolization may offer partial symptomatic relief, but the prognosis remains poor.

          "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common head and neck cancer with low survival rates, especially in advanced stages, despite improved therapies. New developments show that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising treatment options. A better understanding of immune suppression in OSCC could enable new therapeutic approaches and effective ICI combinations.  The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the significance of the differential expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), CD28 and their ligands CD80 and CD86 for the diagnosis and treatment of OSCC. To this end, mRNA expression was analysed by RT-PCR and compared in 65 healthy oral mucosa samples (NOM) and 104 OSCC samples.  The expression of CTLA-4 (a soluble and membrane-bound isoform) was increased in OSCC by 1.72-fold ( = 0.004) and 6.88-fold ( < 0.001), respectively. There was no significant difference for CD28 ( = 0.283), nor for the soluble isoform of CD86 ( = 0.845). The membrane isoform of CD86 was increased in OSCC by a factor of 1.39 ( = 0.009) and CD80 by 6.11-fold ( < 0.001).  The results show a significant association between CTLA-4, CD80 and membrane-bound CD86 expression and diagnosis. They could improve diagnostics in multi-marker approaches and serve as therapeutic targets for ICI strategies. In particular, the data indicate a stronger immunosuppressive role of CD80 compared to CD86 in a tumor tissue context, suggesting the exploration of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CD80 antibody combinations in animal models.",

          "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a complex and highly heterogeneous malignancy marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which facilitates immune evasion and disease progression. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key immune checkpoint molecule expressed on tumor and immune cells, whose activation allows tumors to evade immune surveillance, plays a central role in modulating antitumor immunity in RCC. While the transcriptional and cytokine-mediated regulation of PD-L1 is well documented, emerging evidence emphasizes the critical influence of post-translational modifications particularly ubiquitination and deubiquitination in controlling PD-L1 stability and function. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), highlighting the roles of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs) in modulating PD-L1 expression and their broader implications in RCC tumor biology. We further discuss how these proteins influence immune cell infiltration, tumor progression, and response to immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of targeting UPS components, including proteasome inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras, is also explored. Understanding the UPS-mediated regulation of PD-L1 offers promising avenues for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy in RCC.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases, is the most prevalent form. Treatment options for NSCLC include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapies. Among these, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have demonstrated significant potential, particularly in improving treatment outcomes. However, their clinical efficacy is impeded by challenges such as toxicity, resistance development, and variable patient responses. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut microbiome as an important modulator of immune responses in NSCLC, particularly in the context of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Specific gut microbes, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, have been associated with improved responses to immunotherapy, suggesting that modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance treatment outcomes. This review discusses the current understanding of the influence of gut microbiome on NSCLC and its potential to improve the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. By integrating microbiome-based insights into personalized treatment strategies, we can overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy approaches and optimize patient outcomes. This review aims to serve as a resource for the scientific community by providing insights into how modulation of gut microbiome may enhance treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary liver malignancy, have historically been limited, particularly in unresectable cases with underlying cirrhosis. Initial systemic therapy with antiangiogenic agents, notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as sorafenib, showed modest survival gains but lacked durable responses. Subsequent trials with more potent VEGF pathway inhibitors failed to improve overall survival significantly, raising concerns about the long-term utility and potential hepatic and renal toxicities of prolonged VEGF blockade. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) marked a paradigm shift. Trial results demonstrating that dual-ICI regimens induced more durable responses and achieved higher long-term survival rates have challenged the prior VEGF-centric therapeutic approach and suggest that early use of dual ICIs may offer a more transformative effect on disease trajectory. Although anti-VEGF therapies remain valuable for initial tumor shrinkage, prolonged use may compromise liver regeneration and worsen portal hypertension. A refined treatment strategy emphasizing VEGF inhibition for a limited duration followed by or combined with ICIs may optimize both efficacy and safety. Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for ICI response and on developing regimens that maximize long-term survival in unresectable HCC.",

          "abstract": "Current response evaluation methods have accuracy limitations. Monitoring with a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation-based tumor fraction (TF) may provide a more accurate assessment of tumor burden across solid tumors. In this study, we evaluate a tissue-free, methylation-based TF and explore the association with treatment outcomes in RADIOHEAD, a cohort of 1,070 patients with solid tumors receiving standard of care (SoC) ICI regimens, with blood samples collected prospectively for retrospective analysis. 1,997 baseline and serial on-treatment plasma samples from 627 patients with stage IV cancer were analyzed with an analytically validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) methylation-based ctDNA assay (Guardant Reveal). The primary outcome measure was real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). Secondary outcomes included real-world overall survival (rwOS) and the lead time between non-molecular response (nMR) to rwPFS event. Patients with any decrease in TF while receiving ICI had superior outcomes. Patients with >80% decrease in TF at two timepoints or TF below the limit of quantification (LOQ) had longer rwPFS and rwOS than those with <80% decrease (nMR) (rwPFS HR 0.24 [95% CI 0.19, 0.32] p<0.005; rwOS HR 0.28 [95% CI 0.21, 0.38] p<0.005). nMR was detected prior to clinical progression in 209 patients with a median lead time of 3.03 months. Among 627 stage IV cancer patients receiving SoC ICI, monitoring with methylation-based TF identified patients who have significantly longer rwPFS and rwOS. Changes in TF on ICI can provide additional response data earlier than imaging alone and support the potential of serial monitoring to inform treatment decisions.",

This study evaluates the efficacy and mechanism of local radiotherapy combined with PD 1/PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic triple negative breast cancer treatment. A retrospective analysis of 40 patients divided into a combination group (local radiotherapy + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) and a single-agent group (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) was conducted. Clinical efficacy, progression-free survival, immune cytokine levels (Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-8), and adverse effects were compared. Results showed that the combination therapy significantly improved clinical outcomes and prolonged progression-free survival without increasing toxicity. Patients receiving local radiotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibited reduced immune cytokines, with no significant post-treatment increase in Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-8 levels. These findings suggest that local radiotherapy enhances the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in TNBC treatment without raising the risk of adverse effects.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), represented by atezolizumab and durvalumab, have shown encouraging therapeutic effects in the combination chemotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and have become preferred regimens. It has marked a seminal shift in the treatment landscape with achieving for the first time that overall survival exceed 1\u2009year. However, the extent to which SCLC patients can benefit from ICIs is limited, and ICIs' combination treatment strategies still need to be continuously explored. Beyond the ICIs in combination with radiotherapy, the anti-angiogenic target has been a combination option to improve effectiveness. And the novel formula of immune drugs, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific T cell engager therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy, also promotes the potential option for SCLC patients. Based on the molecular development and biomarkers analysis of the sensitivity to immune checkpoint of the SCLC subtypes, the exploration of new targets and the development of drugs with novel mechanisms may provide fresh hope for immunotherapy in SCLC.",

Large, phase III registrational trials of ICI-containing regimens in resectable and embolization-eligible settings are now reading out. This review summarizes and critically appraises efficacy and safety data from these studies with consideration of the optimal use of ICIs in conjunction with antiangiogenic agents including important issues in management of HCC across the continuum of care such as those related to patient selection, treatment sequencing, and liver preservation. IMbrave050 assessed atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in resected HCC and EMERALD-1 and LEAP-012 evaluated addition of durvalumab-bevacizumab and pembrolizumab-lenvatinib to transarterial chemoembolization in unresectable, embolization-eligible HCC. Both EMERALD-1 and LEAP-012 met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. While IMbrave050 initially met its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival, the adjuvant atezolizumab-bevacizumab benefit was not maintained in an updated analysis. Survival benefits remain unclear for all phase III trials. Safety outcomes can be generally described as predictable based on experience with the respective experimental regimens in the advanced setting. Treatment selection in embolization-eligible settings should consider risks and benefits with special consideration of liver preservation. Additional research is required to optimize ICI combination use in the perioperative and peri-embolization settings.",

          "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. In recent years, the therapeutic arsenal of locally advanced or metastatic ATC has been expanded, with V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-MAPKK  inhibitors for the subset of -mutant ATC. For  wild-type ATC and without other actionable alterations, the most promising strategy is certainly immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown activities both in monotherapy or in combination regimens. However, access to novel treatments is heterogeneous worldwide for ATC patients, and activity of immunotherapy as a single agent is limited. We report the case of a patient with locally advanced  wild-type ATC who achieved a near-complete and durable response following a multimodal treatment approach combining chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), and external beam radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was continued as maintenance therapy, and disease control was maintained for over 1 year. This case highlights the potential efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in  wild-type ATC, especially when a rapid tumor reduction is required. It supports the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with cytotoxic agents as a viable therapeutic option in this aggressive tumor subtype.",

          "abstract": "The most malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), has a high mortality rate. Recently, translational elements in GBM therapy have emerged as novel therapeutic strategies in addition to conventional treatment methods. In this way, Toll-like receptor (TLR), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NOTCH, and other signaling pathways have recently become some of the main signaling pathways in brain tumors. The immunological reactions to brain tumors are mediated by these mechanisms. A family of proteins known as TLRs is essential to the natural defense mechanism because it can identify and react to infections and other danger signals. TLRs have dual functions in the glioma microenvironment including that they can initially activate the innate and adaptive immune responses that support antitumor activity and secondly, their activation can also contribute to tumor progression by promoting inflammation and immune evasion, as they are expressed on both immune cells and tumor cells. TLR agonists are receiving more attention in the treatment of glioma because some of them have demonstrated survival benefits in clinical studies when used in conjunction with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The most exciting use of TLR agonists is that they can be used as immunomodulators to avoid dose accumulation, boost the efficiency of other therapies, and, by upregulating PD-1, reinforce delayed immune checkpoint resistance against PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. Therefore, the use of TLR agonists can lead to PD-L1 overexpression, which in turn enhances the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and triggers potent anticancer immune responses. In this article, we describe the function of the TLR signaling system, the cellular and molecular elements contributing to the etiology of glioblastoma multiforme, the connection between TLRs and glioma, and their significance for immunotherapy.",

Based on the recent North American consortium recommendations, it has been suggested to categorize HLH into two entities, HLH syndrome and HLH disease. HLH disease encompasses multiple subgroups, including familial HLH (F-HLH), HLH-associated immune compromise (IC-HLH) and HLH observed after immune activating therapies. The diagnosis can be quite challenging, and the pathophysiology leading to HLH disease has yet to be fully elucidated. Much less is known about HLH that occurs due to treatment with immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Herein, the authors report a case of a 71-year-old man who was treated with a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for bladder cancer. He later presented with mental status changes and pancytopenia, ultimately meeting the diagnostic criteria for HLH syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Pseudoprogression is an atypical response pattern to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), characterized by initial tumor enlargement or the appearance of new lesions, followed by subsequent tumor regression. While this phenomenon has been observed in several solid tumors, its occurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare and not well understood, presenting diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the first female case of HCC pseudoprogression during atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B-related advanced HCC. After multiple prior treatments, she was started on combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Following four treatment cycles, imaging revealed tumor enlargement and new small lesions, suggestive of disease progression. However, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level had decreased from 45,598 ng/mL to 23,719 ng/mL, and there was no clinical deterioration. Based on these findings, treatment was continued. Imaging after eight and 12 cycles demonstrated marked tumor regression and the normalization of AFP (<2 ng/mL), confirming a diagnosis of pseudoprogression. Although uncommon, pseudoprogression should be considered during ICI therapy for HCC. The accurate interpretation of radiologic findings in conjunction with clinical status and tumor markers is essential to avoid the premature discontinuation of potentially effective treatments. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, predictive markers, and clinical significance of pseudoprogression in HCC.",

          "abstract": "Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. The treatment landscape of gastrointestinal cancer has entered a new era with the advent of immunotherapy, which activates the immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells. Immunotherapy has demonstrated high efficacy and tolerable toxicity profiles compared to conventional therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 in combination with targeted therapy or chemotherapy have been approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors with good clinical patient benefit. In recent years, a variety of novel immunotherapeutic approaches have emerged. For example, adoptive T-cell therapy, such as claudin18.2-targeted CAR-T has achieved an objective remission rate of 48.6% in patients with advanced gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Oncolytic viruses inhibits tumor growth in both tumor lysis and immune activation, and is currently showing its efficacy against gastrointestinal tumors in some clinical trials. In addition, cancer vaccines, with their unique high degree of precision, have improved the effectiveness of individualized therapy. Personalized neoantigen vaccines combined with other immunotherapeutic drugs or chemotherapy, have shown some efficacy and safety in gastrointestinal patients. In this review, we summarize these recent advances in immunotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Additionally, the challenges and limitations linked to immunotherapy were explored. This review will expand our understanding of clinical studies on immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer and assist in individualizing patient treatment strategies, maximizing therapeutic benefits, and improving patient prognosis.",

          "abstract": "Liver metastasis is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Functional modulation of Kupffer cells (KCs) holds promise as an alternative immunotherapeutic approach. Leveraging their capacity to capture circulating virions, an oncolytic virus-based KC-targeting strategy is developed that demonstrated efficacy and safety in treating multifocal liver metastasis. A single intravenous infusion of the M51R mutant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-M51R), but not wild-type (WT) VSV, induced significant tumor regression in mouse models of forced liver metastasis, independent of direct oncolysis. The ineffectiveness of VSV-WT is attributed to its induction of massive KC apoptosis, whereas VSV-M51R replicated transiently within KCs without compromising viability. Instead, VSV-M51R promoted KC proliferation in tumor-adjacent areas, enhancing their access to tumor foci and cross-presentation of tumor antigens. This led to robust activation of hepatic anti-tumor CD8 T-cell responses, which required mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-dependent type I interferon triggering in KCs. Depletion of KCs abolished the T cell stimulating and anti-tumor effects of VSV-M51R. Furthermore, simultaneous blockade of programmed cell death-ligand 1(PD-L1) during VSV-M51R treatment achieved remarkable synergistic efficacy in treating monotherapy-resistant late-stage liver metastasis. These findings underscore the pivotal role of KCs in systemic oncolytic virotherapy and offer a potentially applicable strategy for treating advanced liver metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapy has demonstrated potential in treating various malignant tumors, but its efficacy in pancreatic cancer (PC) remains limited, possibly due to the dense stromal components and immunosuppressive microenvironment of PC. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular signaling pathways. However, the specific role of FAK in the development and progression of PC, as well as its regulatory mechanisms on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM), are still not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed single-cell sequencing datasets and clinical specimens to evaluate the role of FAK in the immune response of PC. We verified the impact of FAK alterations on CD8 T cell infiltration using a co-culture system of patient-derived organoids (PDO) and immune cells. Additionally, mouse PC models and dual humanized models are established to investigate the in vivo function of FAK and the potential of its inhibitors for immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that FAK is associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment in PC. Inhibiting FAK enhances CD8 T cell infiltration by promoting CXCL10\u00a0secretion in PC. Moreover, FAK inhibitors exhibit a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study explores the potential of FAK as a therapeutic target, particularly its role in modulating TIM, thereby providing new research directions for the treatment of PC.",

          "abstract": "Oncolytic immunotherapy, particularly using engineered adenoviruses, has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment due to its dual mechanism of action: selective tumor-cell destruction and inducing potent antitumor immune responses. This review focuses on the immunological effects observed in clinical trials involving conditionally replicating oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds), either with or without transgenes. These viruses primarily exert antitumor effects through mechanisms like direct oncolysis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy, while also activating innate and adaptive immune responses. Different genetic modification strategies have been employed to enhance the safety and therapeutic efficacy of OAds. However, these alterations may influence viral replication dynamics, oncolytic potency, and the duration of viral presence (i.e., persistence) within the tumor. Clinical data have shown that OAds can also profoundly alter the tumor microenvironment (TME), converting cold tumors to hot by increasing immune cell infiltration and activation. This conversion not only correlates with improved clinical outcomes but also creates conditions conducive to the efficacy of other immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which traditionally show limited activity in cold tumors. The synergistic potential of combining OAds with ICIs has shown promising results in improving clinical response rates. However, maximizing therapeutic benefit requires careful consideration of the OAd's immune-activating capabilities and optimal timing of combination strategies. This review provides critical insights into the current state of OAd-based immunotherapy, examining its role in modulating the TME, while addressing the complex interplay between oncolytic activity and sustained immune stimulation in clinical practice.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or durvalumab combined with chemotherapy show promise. However, those immune checkpoint inhibitors are very expensive. Tislelizumab may offer a more affordable alternative for advanced GBC. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report on the case of a 70-year-old patient with GBC who, after experiencing disease progression following standard second-line chemotherapy, was excluded from participating in a clinical trial due to poor performance status. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with stage IVB (TxN2M0) GBC. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with tislelizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. OUTCOMES: The patient had a progression-free survival of 7 months and overall survival of 16 months. The overall overall survival from the onset of the disease was 23 months. LESSONS: The administration of tislelizumab improved survival in a patient with advanced gallbladder cancer. Tislelizumab emerged as a potential more cost-effective alternative option to pembrolizumab or durvalumab in our treatment strategy. These findings provide the basis for large-scale clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of tislelizumab for GBC.",

          "abstract": "RATIONALE: Penile metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an extremely rare clinical entity, particularly in the era of immune-checkpoint inhibitor and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor combination therapy. The mechanisms, clinical presentation, and optimal management of such cases remain poorly understood. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 75-year-old man with metastatic RCC undergoing systemic therapy developed persistent, painful erections (malignant priapism), along with urinary retention, general malaise, and back pain, 2 years after initiating treatment. DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the penis revealed a hypointense lesion on T2-weighted imaging and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging, suggestive of tumor infiltration into the corpus cavernosum. Blood gas analysis from corporal aspiration was consistent with nonischemic priapism. A diagnosis of penile metastasis from RCC was established. INTERVENTIONS: Embolization of the common penile artery was performed, followed by palliative radiotherapy (30 gray in 10 fractions). OUTCOMES: Despite these interventions, penile rigidity persisted, though partial symptomatic relief and pain reduction were achieved. Disease progression was noted, and the patient died approximately 3 months after the diagnosis of penile metastasis. LESSONS: This is the first reported case of penile metastasis from RCC during immune-checkpoint inhibitor-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy, highlighting a rare but clinically important metastatic pattern potentially unmasked by prolonged survival. Retrograde dissemination via Batson venous plexus may underlie this presentation. Radiotherapy and embolization may offer partial symptomatic relief, but the prognosis remains poor. Accumulation of further cases is necessary to guide future management strategies.",

However, not all patients achieve favorable outcomes. Immune hyperprogression is not uncommon in current adjuvant therapy, but the occurrence of metastatic tumors in the form of hyperprogression when the primary tumor is well controlled has not been reported. This case presents a patient who developed immune hyperprogression (duodenal metastasis) during the immune maintenance phase after surgery. This case underscores the potential for ectopic metastases and hyperprogression during immunotherapy. Clinicians are reminded of the importance of cautious immunotherapy, early identification of HPD, and personalized follow-up in the management of immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common head and neck cancer with low survival rates, especially in advanced stages, despite improved therapies. New developments show that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising treatment options. A better understanding of immune suppression in OSCC could enable new therapeutic approaches and effective ICI combinations.  The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the significance of the differential expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), CD28 and their ligands CD80 and CD86 for the diagnosis and treatment of OSCC. To this end, mRNA expression was analysed by RT-PCR and compared in 65 healthy oral mucosa samples (NOM) and 104 OSCC samples.  The expression of CTLA-4 (a soluble and membrane-bound isoform) was increased in OSCC by 1.72-fold ( = 0.004) and 6.88-fold ( < 0.001), respectively. There was no significant difference for CD28 ( = 0.283), nor for the soluble isoform of CD86 ( = 0.845). The membrane isoform of CD86 was increased in OSCC by a factor of 1.39 ( = 0.009) and CD80 by 6.11-fold ( < 0.001).  The results show a significant association between CTLA-4, CD80 and membrane-bound CD86 expression and diagnosis. They could improve diagnostics in multi-marker approaches and serve as therapeutic targets for ICI strategies. In particular, the data indicate a stronger immunosuppressive role of CD80 compared to CD86 in a tumor tissue context, suggesting the exploration of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CD80 antibody combinations in animal models.",
