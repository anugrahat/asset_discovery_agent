      "title": "Effect and Safety of Finerenone in Patients with IgA Nephropathy.",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. METHODS: 42 IgA nephropathy patients treated with finerenone combined with renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASI) and 42 patients who received RASI monotherapy were included in this study. The follow-up duration was 3 months. The efficacy and safety of finerenone were assessed based on key parameters, including urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, serum albumin, hematuria, and serum potassium at 1 and 3 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that finerenone combined with RASI significantly reduced proteinuria in IgA nephropathy patients. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant time * treatment interaction ( = 0.032), and subsequent one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a marked decline in log-transformed UPCR over time in the combination group (P < 0.001) but not in the monotherapy group (P = 0.187). Correspondingly, the combination group achieved a 27.29% reduction in UPCR at one month (95% CI: 13.47-39.68%, P = 0.017) and a 34.17% reduction at three months (95% CI: 21.84-52.75%, P < 0.001) compared to baseline, whereas RASI monotherapy failed to show any significant proteinuria-reduction effects. Notably, the antiproteinuric effect was consistent across subgroups. Serum potassium and creatinine levels remained stable, and no adverse events related to hyperkalemia were observed. CONCLUSION: The retrospective evaluation suggests that finerenone combined with RASI effectively reduced proteinuria in IgA nephropathy patients, underscoring its potential as a viable treatment option for this patient population.",

      "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor () mutations occur in approximately 10-20% of Caucasian and up to 50% of Asian patients with oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most frequently, alterations include exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations, which confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In the last decade, the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib has represented the first-line standard of care for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, the development of acquired mechanisms of resistance significantly impacts long-term outcomes and represents a major therapeutic challenge. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition () gene amplification and MET protein overexpression have emerged as prominent EGFR-independent (off-target) resistance mechanisms, detected in approximately 25% of osimertinib-resistant NSCLC. Noteworthy, variability in diagnostic thresholds, which differ between fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, complicates its interpretation and clinical applicability. To address MET-driven resistance, several therapeutic strategies have been explored, including MET-TKIs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and dual EGFR/MET inhibition has emerged as the most promising strategy. In this context, the bispecific EGFR/MET antibody amivantamab has demonstrated encouraging efficacy, regardless of MET alterations. Furthermore, the combination of the ADC telisotuzumab vedotin and osimertinib has been associated with activity in EGFR-mutant, c-MET protein-overexpressing, osimertinib-resistant NSCLC. Of note, several novel agents and combinations are currently under clinical development. The success of these targeted approaches relies on tissue re-biopsy at progression and accurate molecular profiling. Yet, tumor heterogeneity and procedural limitations may challenge the feasibility of re-biopsy, making biomarker-agnostic strategies viable alternatives.",

Furthermore, the enzymatic score may further be validated as a predictive biomarker.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is a highly diverse disease, and reliable preclinical models that accurately reflect tumor characteristics are essential for studying lung cancer biology and testing new therapies. This study aimed to establish patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) using small biopsy samples and surgical specimens to create a model system that preserves the genetic and histological features of the original tumors.  PDTOs were generated from 163 lung cancer specimens, including 109 samples obtained using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or bronchoscopy, 52 surgical specimens, and 2 pleural fluid samples. The organoid establishment rate beyond passage three was assessed, and histological subtypes and genetic profiles were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining and targeted exome sequencing.  The overall PDTO establishment rate was 34.4% (56/163), and 44.6% (25/56) of these organoids retained the histological and genetic features of the parental tumors. Genetic analysis identified key mutations, including KRAS G12C, EGFR L858R, MET exon 14 skipping mutation, and ROS1 fusion. PDTOs successfully formed tumors in mice while maintaining the genetic characteristics of the original tumors. Co-culture of PDTOs with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) resulted in increased resistance to paclitaxel. In the co-culture model of PDTOs with immune cells, dose-dependent growth inhibition of PDTOs was observed in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  PDTOs established from small biopsy and surgical specimens serve as a valuable model for studying lung cancer biology, tumor microenvironment interactions, and drug response. This model has the potential to improve personalized treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": ": The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein demethylates nuclear N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA, facilitates tumor growth, and contributes to therapeutic resistance in multiple cancer types. Recent evidence demonstrates several roles of FTO in tumorigenesis. In this study, we seek to explore the role of FTO in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenicity and its relationship with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase resistance. : We performed qPCR, immunoblotting, viability assays, migration assays, and ATP assays to investigate the functions of FTO in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, specifically to erlotinib, in three NSCLC cell lines harboring either wild-type or mutant EGFR. We also performed immunohistochemistry on lung tumor tissues from patients diagnosed at different stages of NSCLC. : Our study found an upregulation of FTO in erlotinib-resistant (ER) cell lines at both the gene and protein levels. FTO inhibition and knockdown significantly reduced cell viability of erlotinib-resistant H2170 and PC9 cells by over 30% when treated with 0.8 \u00b5M of Dac51 and about 20% when treated with siFTO. FTO inhibition also slowed down the migration of ER cells, and the effect was even more pronounced when combined with erlotinib. Furthermore, FTO was found to be overexpressed in late-stage NSCLC tumor tissues compared to early-stage tumors, and it was upregulated in patients who smoked. : These findings suggest FTO might mediate resistance and tumor growth by augmenting cell proliferation. In addition, FTO can be a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC patients.",

However, most patients inevitably experience tumor relapse owing to drug resistance. We aimed to identify potential serum biomarkers for predicting post-EGFR-TKI treatment relapse in patients with advanced-stage lung ADC. : Among 27 patients, including 6 and 21 with early and late relapse, respectively, differentially expressed proteins between patients with early and late relapses were identified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry and subsequently validated using Western blotting. Predictive ability was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) analysis. The association between the clinical variables and treatment response was evaluated using the chi-square test. : The serum expression levels of the translocated promoter region (TPR), junction plakoglobin (JUP), and fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) were significantly higher in patients with late rather than early relapse. The findings indicated that TPR and FGA exhibited good diagnostic performance, with AUCs of 0.946 ( = 0.002; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.05) and 0.809 ( = 0.034; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97), respectively. : Our results suggest that the TPR and FGA levels are potential predictors of post-EGFR-TKI treatment relapse.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown marked efficacy for HER2 mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The intracellular trafficking of mutant HER2 has remained to be fully elucidated, however. METHODS: HER2 dynamics were examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant HER2 with the use of live cell imaging and an in situ proximity ligation assay. Proteins related to mutant HER2 trafficking were identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: HER2 internalization was enhanced in NSCLC cells expressing mutant HER2 compared with those expressing HER2(WT). Homodimers of HER2(WT) were localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas those of mutant HER2 were present mostly in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of EGFR or HER3 suppressed internalization of HER2(WT) but not that of mutant HER2. The enhanced internalization of mutant HER2 was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as was reflected by increased binding of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to mutant HER2 and its consequent ubiquitination, and was attenuated by treatment with zongertinib, a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of HER2 phosphorylation promotes internalization of mutant HER2 mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, likely contributing to the efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs in NSCLC positive for HER2 mutations.",

Deep learning approaches are becoming cost-effective alternatives to high-throughput experimental methods for ligand identification.

Ligand-Transformer implements a sequence-based approach, where the inputs are the amino acid sequence of the target protein and the topology of the\u00a0small molecule to enable the prediction of the conformational space explored by the complex between the two. We apply Ligand-Transformer to screen and validate experimentally inhibitors targeting the mutant EGFR kinase, identifying compounds with low nanomolar potency. We then use this approach to predict the conformational population shifts induced by known ABL kinase inhibitors, showing that sequence-based predictions enable the characterisation of the population shift upon binding. Overall, our results illustrate the potential of Ligand-Transformer to accurately predict the interactions of small molecules with proteins, including the binding affinity and the changes in the free energy landscapes upon binding,\u00a0thus uncovering molecular mechanisms and facilitating the initial steps in drug design.",

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched until December 20, 2024. This study analyzed the effects of complement inhibitors on the 24-h urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (24-h UPCR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the incidence of adverse events in IgAN. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies with 398 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. In patients with IgAN, complement inhibitors significantly attenuated the decline in eGFR [MD\u2009=\u20093.50\u00a0ml/min/1.73 m, 95% CI (0.44, 6.57),\u00a0P\u2009<\u20090.05] and demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing proteinuria markers: a 24-h UPCR reduction of -0.71\u00a0g/g [95% CI (-0.91, -0.50),\u00a0P\u2009<\u20090.05] was observed. Safety analyses revealed comparable tolerability between the intervention and control groups, with no statistically significant difference in adverse event incidence [RR\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI (0.74, 1.11),\u00a0P\u2009=\u20090.35].

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations, including amplifications, mutations, and fusions, are prevalent in GBM and represent potential therapeutic targets. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has demonstrated efficacy in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer and central nervous system metastases. However, its efficacy in GBM remains uncertain. We present 2 cases of recurrent GBM harboring distinct EGFR alterations treated with osimertinib. Both patients, despite showing EGFR amplification or activating mutations (G719D), experienced rapid disease progression and clinical deterioration during treatment. These findings highlight the resistance of GBM to osimertinib, possibly due to tumor heterogeneity, subclonal variation, or intrinsic mechanisms linked to EGFR amplification and redundant oncogenic pathways. Our observations align with prior trials of EGFR-TKIs in GBM, which have shown limited benefit. These cases underscore the complexity of targeting EGFR in GBM and the need for advanced therapeutic approaches, including next-generation EGFR inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, to overcome resistance. Further studies are crucial to optimize EGFR-targeted therapies in GBM.",

      "title": "Targeting the molecular crosstalk between diabetes and lung cancer for therapeutic intervention.",
      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review investigates the complex association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and lung cancer, focusing on shared risk factors, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications. We aim to quantify the impact of T2DM on lung cancer incidence, progression, and treatment response, and evaluate the role of glycemic control and antidiabetic therapies. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted following a targeted search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for published studies. Search terms included \"type 2 diabetes mellitus,\" \"lung cancer,\" \"non-small cell lung cancer,\" \"hyperglycemia,\" \"insulin resistance,\" and relevant synonyms. Inclusion criteria were original research articles, meta-analyses, and clinical trials involving human subjects that explored epidemiological associations, molecular mechanisms, pharmacologic interventions, or prognostic implications of T2DM in lung cancer. Studies focusing solely on type 1 diabetes, animal models, or non-English language were excluded. Key findings were synthesized to provide mechanistic insights and clinical relevance. RESULTS: Epidemiological evidence indicates a 20-48% increased relative risk of lung cancer in individuals with T2DM, with incidence rates reaching 125 per 100,000 in diabetics versus 85 per 100,000 in non-diabetics. Shared risk factors include obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. Molecular pathways such as K-Ras and PI3K/Akt activation, IGF-1R overexpression, and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. Metformin is associated with reduced lung cancer incidence and improved progression-free survival (58% vs. 37% at 2 years). Pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors show potential benefits, though clinical evidence remains mixed. CONCLUSION: T2DM significantly influences lung cancer biology and prognosis. Integrating glycemic control with cancer therapy-particularly metformin and EGFR-TKI combinations-offers promising avenues for improving outcomes. Future research should focus on biomarker-driven stratification and targeted therapeutic strategies tailored to diabetic lung cancer patients.",

      "title": "[Penile carcinoma: the importance of histological classification and new treatment strategies].",
      "abstract": "Penile carcinoma is a rare malignancy, predominantly derived from squamous epithelium, with a partially aggressive clinical course. The 2022 WHO classification distinguishes HPV-associated (HPV(+)) and HPV-independent (HPV(-)) subtypes, a differentiation that bears significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. HPV(-) carcinomas often develop as result of chronic inflammation, e.g. lichen sclerosus. While HPV(+) tumours, such as the warty subtype, often exhibit an indolent course, basaloid and sarcomatoid variants are associated with poor prognosis and an increased risk of metastasis.The prognostic value of HPV status alone is still inconsistent across studies. In contrast, p16 overexpression as surrogate marker for HPV infection, has been linked to improved survival outcomes. A combined assessment of HPV and p16 status is therefore recommended, particularly for therapeutic decision-making. In HPV(-) tumours, additional analysis of p53 expression is advisable, as TP53 mutations - frequently observed in this group - are associated with more aggressive tumour biology.Beyond conventional platinum-based chemotherapy, targeted therapies are gaining attention. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as enfortumab vedotin (targeting Nectin-4) and sacituzumab govitecan (targeting Trop-2) have shown promising efficacy in other tumour types. Both targets are also expressed in penile carcinoma, and early clinical trials are underway. HER2 is expressed in a relevant proportion of cases and may be an additional therapeutic target.Immune checkpoint inhibitors like atezolizumab have so far demonstrated limited efficacy in penile cancer, despite high rates of PD-L1 expression. This discrepancy may be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies are also a potential treatment option.Accurate histopathological and molecular characterisation is critical for personalised treatment approaches and should become an integral component of the clinical management of penile carcinoma.",

      "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-bound protein that interacts with epidermal growth factor, triggering receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation, subsequently promoting cell proliferation. EGFR-associated pathways regulate cell housekeeping functions like growth, division, and apoptosis. However, the mutations/overexpression of EGFR cause unrestrained cell differentiation, leading to tumorigenesis. This study proposes a machine-learning-based tool, EGFR, to compute novel molecules' biological activities (pIC) against EGFR. The tool is based on a robust quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model, trained on a large dataset of existing EGFR inhibitors using multiple machine learning algorithms. The extra trees regressor (ET) model showed promising results for the training dataset with an   value of 0.99, an RMSE value of 0.07 and an MAE of 0.009. The Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted pIC values of the training set inhibitors was also very substantial,  0.99. The model was then validated using a test dataset, and the findings were satisfactory. An   value of 0.67, an RMSE of 0.89 and an MAE of 0.61 were detected for the test dataset, and the Pearson correlation coefficient of observed/predicted pIC values was 0.82. The model was probed for overfitting using 10-fold cross-validation, and a series of structure-based drug design experiments were performed to validate the tool's predictions. The findings backed up the model's performance. This tool will be of significant importance to medicinal chemists in identifying promising EGFR inhibitors.",

METHODS: The retrospective study enrolled 140 patients between May 2017 and December 2022 from Center 1, and 45 patients between January 2015 and March 2024 from Center 2. All patients underwent an F-FDG PET/CT scan. Patients with BM underwent brain MRI. Radiomics features were extracted from both primary lesion and BM and selected using max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) method. A logistic regression model was developed based on primary lesion and BM, and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the applicability. RESULTS: A total of 7 and 5 important features were selected from primary lesion and BM, respectively. The SUVmax was identified as the most predictive clinical indicator. The developed nomogram based on primary lesion generated AUCs of 0.832, 0.775 and 0.798 in training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram based on BM yielded AUCs of 0.985, 0.921 and 0.956 in training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that radiomics features from PET/CT and MRI of primary lesion and BM can be predictive of response to EGFR-TKI. The constructed nomogram may be considered as a non-invasive tool to stratify which patient can benefit from the EGFR-TKI therapy.",

METHODS: Consecutive eligible patients were prospectively enrolled in 16-centers in China. The primary endpoints were second-line (2\u2009L) treatment patterns and clinical outcomes, including median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) from 2\u2009L treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 300 patients were enrolled in the study, and among them, 291 patients were included in the Full Analysis Set, and 213(73.2%) underwent molecular testing, after progression from 1\u2009L therapy. 30.5% (65/213) had tissue samples, while 66.7% (142/213) had plasma samples. In tissue and plasma samples, T790M positive rates were 53.8% and 43.7%, respectively. mPFS and mOS for patients with T790M positive who received third generation (3\u2009G) EGFR-TKIs as 2\u2009L therapy were 14.7\u2009months and 32.0\u2009months, respectively. The mPFS for patients with T790M negative who received 3\u2009G EGFR-TKIs, prior EGFR-TKIs plus local therapy, and chemotherapy as 2\u2009L therapy were 7.6\u2009months, 10.2\u2009months, and 4.9\u2009months, respectively. The corresponding mOS for these patients were 21.2\u2009months, 16.6\u2009months, and 15.0\u2009months, respectively. No new safety signal emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acquired resistance to first generation (1\u2009G)/second generation (2\u2009G) EGFR-TKIs receiving 3\u2009G EGFR-TKIs, especially T790M positive, showed better clinical outcomes after molecular testing.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension, a prevalent cardiovascular disorder, exerts detrimental effects on the respiratory system. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. METHODS: We conducted comparative transcriptomic profiling via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of lung tissues from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Additionally, we assessed the effects of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) interventions on mRNA and protein expression profiles in SHR pulmonary tissue using integrated omics approaches. RESULTS: Core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in SHR versus WKY comparisons included Nuf2 and Cenpa, with significant enrichment in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In SHR versus ARB-treated cohorts, hub genes Ccnb2 and Mad2l1 demonstrated primary pathway enrichment in cell cycle regulation and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. ARNI intervention yielded distinct hub genes (Gzma, Icam1) enriched in PI3K/AKT signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions. Proteomic analysis confirmed concordant expression patterns for EGFR and JUN proteins with transcriptomic findings. CONCLUSION: ARB and ARNI therapies mitigate hypertension-induced pulmonary damage through divergent molecular mechanisms, with PI3K/AKT signaling and ECM-receptor interactions serving as central regulatory hubs in this protective process.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2i depends on baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but whether the same is true for the blood pressure lowering effect is unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed (Study 1) and analysed data from a clinical study (Study 2) to investigate if the blood pressure lowering effect of SGLT2i depends on baseline eGFR. In the literature review, we performed a weighted regression analysis with mean change in SBP and DBP as dependent variables and mean eGFR as an independent variable. Furthermore, we analyzed data from a cohort of 48 patients with either type 2 diabtes mellitus with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) or non-diabetic CKD with varying degrees of kidney function. RESULTS: 2069 articles were identified of which 27 articles met the inclusion criteria. Analysis revealed a mean weighted reduction in SBP -4.7 mmHg compared to baseline and -3.5 mmHg compared to placebo. The weighted regression analysis showed no correlation between change in SBP and baseline eGFR. Data analysis of 48 patients revealed a SBP reduction of 5.5 mmHg and the simple linear regression revealed no correlation between the decrease in blood pressure and baseline eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: The blood pressure lowering effect of SGLT2i does not depend on baseline eGFR.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), PD-1 and EGFR inhibitors are effective in a considerable proportion of patients. However, there is an unmet medical need for patients with perianogenital cSCC or cSCC refractory to PD-1 therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre phase-2 trial enrolled patients with advanced cSCC (prior systemic therapy allowed) to receive the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab (10 mg/kg q2w) plus the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab (500 mg/m2 q2w) for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint was objective response (OR). Predefined subgroups were line of therapy and localisation of the primary tumor (perianogenital/other locations). RESULTS: Of 52 enrolled patients, 49 received at least 1 dose of treatment. Of these, 20 patients achieved an OR (41%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 27-56, 9 partial/11 complete responses (PRs/CRs)). While treatment-na\u00efve patients (n=35) achieved a higher OR rate (46%, 95% CI 29-63) than those pretreated (29%, 95% CI 8-58), 4/14 pretreated patients experienced an OR, 2 with prior PD-1 inhibition. 5 out of 14 patients with perianogenital cSCC achieved an OR (36%, 95% CI 13-65), including 4 CRs. At a median follow-up of 35 months, the median progression free/overall survival (PFS/OS) was 8.4/23.1 months. Grade 1-2 treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were common, while grade 3 or higher events occurred in only 10 patients (20%) and 7 patients experienced serious TRAEs (14%); 2 discontinued treatment due to drug-related toxicity. Notably, quality of life improved, especially in patients with perianogenital primaries. CONCLUSIONS: Avelumab in combination with cetuximab demonstrates encouraging clinical activity in advanced cSCC, including patients with challenging subgroups such as perianogenital primaries or those with disease that has progressed on anti-PD-1 monotherapy. This is especially true when patients are carefully selected for their ability to undergo treatment for at least 12 weeks.",
