      },
      "abstract": "Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), a crucial anti-apoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family, has been extensively documented to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers, where it is essential for fostering cancer cell survival and treatment resistance. Elevated levels of MCL-1 have been observed in hematological cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma, as well as in multiple solid tumors. We therefore examined the potential inhibitory effects of  compounds on MCL-1 using a computational drug discovery approach. Molecular docking analyses, including Glide XP (extra precision) were performed to evaluate the binding affinities of the compounds against the prepared crystal structure of MCL-1 (PDB ID: 6FS1) within the Schr\u00f6dinger Suites. Additionally, the binding free energies of the compounds were computed to assess their thermodynamic stability within the binding pocket. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the identified compounds were analyzed based on Lipinski's Rule of Five (RO5), electrostatic potential distribution, and ADME predictions. Predictive models for MCL-1 inhibitors were developed using AutoQSAR to examine the drug-likeness and biological activity of the screened compounds. We found 12 hit compounds, most of which met the RO5 criteria and were in the suggested ADME parameter range. Additionally, the predicted pIC50 values for these compounds were promising, suggesting their potential as MCL-1 inhibitors. The results of this study offer insightful analysis for the rational design of new anticancer treatments aimed at MCL-1.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of the durable cell cycle arrest of dysfunctional cells, which has been associated with the promotion of tumor cell reprogramming into a stem cell state. We previously reported that the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor CEP-1347 promotes the differentiation of glioma stem cells (GSCs)-key contributors to glioblastoma recurrence and therapy resistance-into non-stem tumor cells. However, we also noted that CEP-1347-treated GSCs exhibited a morphological change suggestive of senescence. Therefore, we herein investigated whether CEP-1347 induces senescence in GSCs and, consequently, if senescent GSCs may be eliminated using senolytics. Cell death induced by CEP-1347 in combination with senolytic agents or with the knockdown of anti-apoptotic  family genes, as well as the effects of CEP-1347 on the expression of senescence markers and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, were examined. The results obtained showed that CEP-1347 induced senescence in GSCs accompanied by the increased expression of Bcl-xL. Among the panel of senolytic agents tested, navitoclax, a BH3 mimetic, efficiently induced cell death in GSCs when combined with CEP-1347 at concentrations clinically achievable in the brain. The knockdown of Bcl-xL resulted in more pronounced GSC death in combination with CEP-1347 than that of Bcl-2. These results suggest that combining CEP-1347 with the targeting of Bcl-xL, the expression of which increases with CEP-1347-induced senescence, is a rational approach to ensure the elimination of GSCs, thereby improving the outcomes of glioblastoma treatment.",

      "title": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Novel Therapeutic Targets Under Investigation.",
      "abstract": "CLL is the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries, characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes. Over the past decade, the therapeutic landscape for CLL has undergone significant transformations, primarily due to the introduction of targeted small molecular therapies like BTK inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors, that have improved patient outcomes drastically. Despite significant advances, long-term disease management remains challenging for patients with double-refractory CLL, where responses with subsequent therapies are short-lived. Resistance to these therapies can arise through several mechanisms like kinase-altering BTK mutations, alterations in the BCL-2 pathway, and adaptations within the tumor microenvironment, necessitating the exploration of new therapeutic options. This review provides an in-depth overview of the promising novel treatment approaches under investigation in CLL, focusing on advanced cellular therapies (CAR T-cell therapy), T-cell engagers, new monoclonal antibodies, and various next-generation small molecule inhibitors including BTK degraders, PI3K inhibitors, MALT1 inhibitors, c-MYC inhibitors, CDK9 inhibitors, and agents targeting angiogenesis and DNA damage repair. In this review, we will discuss the novel therapeutic targets and agents as well as ongoing trials, emphasizing the potential of these treatments to overcome resistance and meet the unmet needs of patients, particularly those with double-refractory CLL.",

      "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a prevalent hematologic malignancy that predominantly affects elderly individuals, posing significant clinical challenges due to patient comorbidities and inherent resistance to conventional chemotherapy. The emergence of targeted therapies combining venetoclax, a selective inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has dramatically transformed the treatment landscape.  This retrospective observational study analyzed the differential impacts of first-line venetoclax-obinutuzumab (VenO) and second-line venetoclax-rituximab (VenR) on immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in CLL patients.  Our findings indicate that during first-line VenO therapy, a significant improvement in ANC levels from baseline was observed, whereas patients undergoing second-line VenR therapy demonstrated limited impact on ANC and the decreasing tendency in IgG levels. Patients treated with VenR had a longer disease history and previous exposure to other treatment regimens, primarily chemoimmunotherapy, which could negatively influence immune recovery, making direct comparisons between these two treatment lines challenging. Although this observational study did not directly compare infection rates, the observed enhancement of ANC levels in patients receiving VenO suggests a potential for lower infection risk compared to pretreated VenR patients.  These results underscore the clinical significance of considering both the treatment line and the patient's prior therapeutic history when selecting venetoclax-based regimens for CLL. The potential association of first-line VenO with improved immunological parameters and the complex impact of prior therapies on immunological recovery with second-line VenR warrant further prospective investigation into the correlation between treatment regimen, patient history, immune function, and infectious complications.",

      "abstract": ": Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity (VIN) remains a significant clinical challenge, with no effective nephroprotective agent currently established. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) against VIN in a Wistar albino rat model. : Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control, VA (vancomycin), DAPA (dapagliflozin), and VA+DAPA. Renal function was assessed by measuring serum urea and creatinine. Oxidative stress markers [malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidant status (TOS), and myeloperoxidase (MPO)], antioxidant enzyme activities [total antioxidant status (TAS), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], apoptotic mediators (Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3), and pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] were evaluated. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of kidney tissues were also performed. : Administration of VA led to significant renal dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, heightened apoptotic activity, and notable histopathological damage. Co-administration of DAPA with VA significantly reduced serum urea and creatinine levels and decreased caspase-3 activity and was associated with a trend toward reduction in both MDA levels and TNF-\u03b1 expression, as well as the amelioration of histopathological renal injury. However, reductions in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels were not statistically significant. Overall, these findings indicate that DAPA exerts nephroprotective effects against VIN by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic pathways. : Dapagliflozin may serve as a potential protective agent against vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity. Further long-term and large-scale clinical studies are warranted to validate these preclinical findings and explore their therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Since genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics have provided only a partial explanation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) heterogeneity, and since concordance between mRNA and protein expression is incomplete, we related the CLL proteome to clinical outcome. CLL samples from patients who received fludarabine-containing chemoimmunotherapy were analysed by mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS). One dataset compared pre-treatment samples associated with an optimal versus suboptimal response, while another compared paired samples collected before treatment and at disease progression. eIF2 signalling (pivotal to the unfolded protein response (UPR)), was identified as the most enriched pathway in both datasets (respective z-scores: -\u00a06.245 and 3.317; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), as well as in a fludarabine-resistant CLL cell line established from HG3 cells (z-score: -\u00a02.121; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Western blotting revealed that fludarabine-resistant HG3 cells expressed higher levels of PERK, which phosphorylates the regulatory eIF2\u03b1 subunit, and lower levels of BiP, an HSP70 molecular chaperone that inactivates PERK but preferentially binds to misfolded proteins during ER stress. The PERK inhibitor, GSK2606414, sensitised resistant, but not sensitive, HG-3 cells to fludarabine without affecting background cell viability or cytotoxicity induced by the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. These findings identify the UPR as a novel determinant of therapy outcome and disease progression in CLL.",

      "title": "Repurposing BCL2 inhibitors: Venetoclax protects against acinar cell necrosis in acute pancreatitis by promoting apoptosis.",
      "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP), a severe inflammatory disorder of the pancreas, lacks effective pharmacological treatment. The disease is primarily driven by necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells (PACs), which intensifies inflammation and organ injury. This study explores the potential of BCL2 inhibitors, specifically Navitoclax and Venetoclax, to shift cell death pathways from necrosis to apoptosis and thereby mitigate disease severity. Ex vivo models using cerulein or ethanol/palmitoleic acid (EtOH/POA) showed that both inhibitors significantly reduced necrosis, increased apoptosis, and improved PAC viability and ATP levels. In mouse models of AP, both drugs promoted apoptosis and decreased tissue necrosis, with Venetoclax showing superior efficacy and safety. Venetoclax markedly reduced disease severity in two AP models without affecting healthy tissue or inducing thrombocytopenia. In contrast, Navitoclax caused apoptosis even in healthy tissue and triggered thrombocytopenia. Additionally, both drugs attenuated pathological Ca responses in PACs and upregulated the expression of Ca\u00b2\u207a-binding proteins S100A8/A9 and the chemokine CCL8. The latter may mediate enhanced apoptotic clearance and limit secondary necrosis, supporting the therapeutic shift from necrosis to apoptosis. Proteomic analyses revealed extensive drug-induced remodeling. In the short-term AP model, both inhibitors altered expression of proteins linked to intracellular compartments and extracellular signaling, reflecting cellular adaptation. In CP, Navitoclax upregulated ECM and lysosomal proteins while downregulating ribosomal components-indicating intensified fibrosis and suppressed protein synthesis. Venetoclax had milder effects and did not worsen fibrosis. Despite Navitoclax's efficacy toward activated pancreatic stellate cells in vitro, it exacerbated fibrosis and tissue atrophy in CP in vivo, likely due to ongoing parenchymal damage and stellate cell activation. Together, these findings demonstrate that selective BCL2 inhibition with Venetoclax promotes apoptosis, reduces necrosis, and improves outcomes in AP, supporting its repurposing as a therapeutic strategy. However, BCL2 inhibition does not benefit CP and may aggravate fibrosis, underscoring the need for context-specific approaches.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of Protein expression of protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor evolocumab on cardiac function in rats with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: The AMI model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery in rats. The mRNA expression of PCSK9 in myocardial tissues was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Echocardiography was used to examine the cardiac function indexes. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson stainings were used to detect myocardial pathologic injury. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to detect myocardial infarction area. Serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were detected by ELISA. CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) positive expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression levels of PCSK9, Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved-caspase3, receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), and p-MLKL were detected in myocardial tissues by western blot. RESULTS: The mRNA level and protein expression of PCSK9 were significantly increased in AMI rats. PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced the levels of LDL-C and TC in serum, thereby improving dyslipidemia. And, evolocumab up-regulated the levels of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), and down-regulated the levels of left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV), and left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), which in turn improved cardiac function. In addition, evolocumab attenuated myocardial pathological injury, reduced myocardial infarction area, lowered the levels of LDH, CK-MB, cTnT, IL-1\u03b2, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1, and inhibited apoptosis rate, down-regulated Bax, cleaved-caspase3, RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, p-MLKL expression, and up-regulated Bcl-2 protein expression, CD31 and VEGF positive expression. CONCLUSION: The PCSK 9 inhibitor evolocumab improved cardiac function in AMI rats, and the mechanism may be related to the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway.",

      "abstract": "Resistance to the Bcl-2-specific inhibitor, Venetoclax (VEN), poses a therapeutic challenge in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Although VEN resistance has been linked to Mcl-1 upregulation, thereby switching survival dependence from Bcl-2 to Mcl-1, the mechanism underlying increased Mcl-1 expression remains elusive. Given that changes in cellular redox state affect cancer cell fate, we investigated the crosstalk between intracellular redox milieu and Mcl-1 upregulation in VEN-resistant cells. Results show that increased Mcl-1 protein levels in VEN-resistant hematologic malignant cells are associated with elevated intracellular superoxide (O) levels. Validating that, augmenting intracellular O in VEN-sensitive cells increases Mcl-1 phosphorylation at threonine-163 (T163pMcl-1) and protein stability via reduced Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, redox-activated AKT/PKB is implicated in O-induced T163pMcl-1, as reducing intracellular O or inhibiting AKT significantly decreases T163pMcl-1 and Mcl-1 accumulation, which amplifies mitochondrial apoptotic priming and restores VEN sensitivity. Importantly, combination therapy with AKT inhibitor, capivasertib, and VEN reduced VEN-resistant cells systemically and prolonged survival in a murine model. Collectively, a novel redox-dependent mechanism of Mcl-1 stability is demonstrated for the acquisition of VEN resistance, which has therapeutic implications for employing redox modulating strategies and AKT inhibitors against VEN-resistant hematologic malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most aggressive and challenging brain tumors. Unfortunately, current clinical treatment options offer limited efficacy, highlighting the necessity for uncovering novel therapeutic strategies. Here, monotherapy and combination library screening were employed, and identified that the efficacy of obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitor, was improved significantly when combined with ER-stress inducers, including tunicamycin. Combinatorial knockdown of anti-apoptotic proteins confirmed that the loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL synergistically enhanced apoptosis under ER stress conditions. Although ER stress inducers triggered the stress response in GBM cells, obatoclax co-treatment enhanced this response by upregulating ATF-4 and CHOP, which promoted apoptosis along with increased caspase 3/7 activity and cleavage of PARP. ATF-4 knockdown significantly decreased the apoptosis induced by obatoclax and tunicamycin co-treatment and reduced the expression of CHOP and BIM. Under ER stress responses, GBM cells exerted an autophagy response to recover from the stress condition; however, obatoclax co-treatment disrupted the autophagy responses, particularly by disrupting autophagic cargo degradation. Our findings suggest that targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, coupled with ER-stress induction, could be a promising strategy for the treatment of GBM, highlighting the potential for combination therapies involving pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitors to overcome current limitations in the treatment of GBM.",

      "title": "Evaluating the Polypharmacological potential of cosmetic preservative imidurea against lung Cancer-associated EGFR, CDK2, STAT3, BCL2, p53, and ABCB1 proteins.",
      "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, with both small and non-small cell lung cancer contributing to an estimated 1.80 million deaths annually. Drug resistance in LC treatment causes around 700,000 deaths globally and poses major economic challenges. While nearly 100 FDA-approved LC drugs exist, most target single proteins or pathways, making resistance more likely. There is an urgent need for multitargeted drugs that inhibit multiple pathways to reduce resistance and side effects. In this study, we examined 34 proteins from various LC-related pathways and prepared them for screening against the DrugBank library. Using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) docking algorithms in Glide, we identified Imidurea (DB14075) as a promising multitargeted inhibitor. Docking scores ranged from -5.507 to -12.155\u202fkcal/mol, and poses were refined through MM/GBSA calculations. Molecular fingerprinting was performed to analyse interaction patterns, and DFT and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Bonding angles were optimised to evaluate relative binding energy, followed by 100\u202fns MD simulations in water to assess stability and effectiveness. Imidurea showed strong multitargeted inhibitory effects across all 34 LC proteins, with docking scores between -5.507 and\u202f-\u202f12.155\u202fkcal/mol. MD simulations further supported its stability in binding to these targets. In MTT assays on A549 cells, Imidurea demonstrated dose-dependent anticancer effects, causing significant cell cycle arrest and cell death at 100\u202f\u03bcg/mL. Imidurea is an affordable compound with promising multitargeted anticancer potential, particularly beneficial for developing nations and underprivileged groups. While these computational and in vitro MTT assays are encouraging, further detailed in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to validate their efficacy and safety before clinical application.",

      "title": "Reversal of neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by combined exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid in zebrafish through targeting DRP-1: insights into mitophagy and apoptosis mechanisms.",
      "abstract": "Neonicotinoid pesticides, including acetamiprid (ACE) and imidacloprid (IMI), are widely used due to their high efficacy and broad-spectrum activity. Despite IMI prohibition in certain countries by 2023, its residual effects, particularly in conjunction with ACE, which is frequently detected at elevated concentrations in rivers and surface waters, remain inadequately explored. In this study, the combined neurodevelopmental toxicity of ACE and IMI in zebrafish was investigated, with emphasis on mitochondrial dynamics and potential intervention strategies. We developed a 120-h acute exposure model using zebrafish embryos and a long-term chronic exposure model involving six months of environmentally relevant doses in adult zebrafish. Various parameters were systematically assessed using these models, including general toxicity, larval behavioral characteristics, outcomes of the novel tank diving test and light-dark test in adults, neurodevelopmental status, associated gene expression levels, and mitochondrial function. Furthermore, exposure experiments were conducted using transgenic zebrafish larvae Tg (huc:eGFP) and Tg (hb9:eGFP) to elucidate specific effects on the nervous system. Human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were used to evaluate apoptosis, oxidative stress, ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and calcium ion concentrations. Protein markers associated with apoptosis (Bax, BCL-2, and Cleaved Caspase-3) and mitophagy (LC3A/B, P62, Parkin, and Pink-1) were analyzed. Additionally, DRP-1, Bax, and CytC levels were quantified in both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions. The DRP-1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 was used to substantiate the role of mitochondrial dynamics. The results revealed a synergistic neurotoxic effect resulting from the combined exposure to ACE and IMI, which was characterized by impaired neural development, behavioral abnormalities, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with Mdivi-1 ameliorated these effects, reducing neurotoxicity in zebrafish. This study elucidates the synergistic neurodevelopmental toxicity of ACE and IMI, underscores the pivotal role of mitochondrial pathways, and provides insights into potential mitigation strategies for neonicotinoid-induced neurotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Carbohydrate derivatives and 1,4-naphthoquinone analogues are crucial in many life-saving drugs, and their presence in numerous FDA-approved medications underscores their significance in drug design. In light of this, we have identified a mild and efficient copper-catalyzed click chemistry reaction conditions to synthesize two new series of 1,4-naphthoquinone based triazole-linked glycoconjugates as chiral glycohybrids, and evaluated their anticancer activity against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cell lines. A significant number of glycohybrids showed anticancer activity against A549 cells with IC in the micromolar range. It was observed that these glycohybrids caused cell death in A549 cells through the induction of apoptosis. Specifically, compounds 5c (IC\u00a0=\u00a05.17\u00a0\u03bcM), from O-triazole-linked series; and 6d (IC\u00a0=\u00a07.89\u00a0\u03bcM) from N-triazole-linked series were most effective anticancer molecules. These two compounds were found to inhibit the cell growth of resistant lung cancer cells H1922 (IC\u00a0=\u00a07.97\u00a0\u03bcM for 5c and 6.94\u00a0\u03bcM for 6d) and H1975 (IC\u00a0=\u00a09.74\u00a0\u03bcM for 5c and 9.59\u00a0\u03bcM for 6d) at sub-micromolar concentration. These active glycohybrids induced apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl and activating the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax leading to a significantly increased ratio of Bax/Bcl which suggests cell death through apoptosis. The detailed results obtained suggest that triazole-linked glycoconjugates synthesized by us using copper-catalyzed click chemistry reactions exhibit anti-cancer properties against lung cancer cells by inducing apoptotic cell death in-vitro. Additionally, molecular docking studies of these glycohybrids against EGFR (PDB ID:1M17) protein (over-expressed in non-small A549 lung cancer cells) revealed significant interactions between the protein and our synthesized glycohybrids (ligands) at the active site. Thus, the molecular docking studies with EGFR protein show that compound 5c, with a superior docking score of\u00a0-6.78\u00a0kcal/mol, could be the most promising inhibitor of EGFR.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of B-cell malignancies with the PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) idelalisib often results in high toxicity and resistance, with limited treatment alternatives for relapsed/refractory patients since idelalisib is recommended as a later or last line therapy. To investigate resistance mechanisms and identify alternative treatments, we studied functional phenotypes of idelalisib-resistant B-cell malignancy models. The idelalisib-resistant KARPAS1718 model remained sensitive to Bcl-2 inhibitors (Bcl-2i), whereas the resistant VL51 model showed reduced sensitivity compared to parental cells. Sensitivity correlated with phosphorylation and expression of the Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bim. Target addiction scoring revealed high dependence on the proteasome, and proteasome inhibitors (PI) were effective across models and in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, independently of their PI3Ki- or Bcl-2i-sensitivities. PI treatment consistently upregulated Bim and Mcl-1, while Bcl-2 increased in KARPAS1718 and CLL cells. Bcl-2i plus PI combinations led to an additive effect in these models. A multi-refractory CLL patient in the IMPRESS-Norway trial (NCT04817956) treated with Bcl-2i plus PI showed initial clinical improvement but relapsed within four months. Treatment induced Bim and Mcl-1 upregulation and reduced cytotoxic CD8 T-cell and CD56 NK-cell populations. Our findings suggest that PIs may overcome resistance to targeted therapies, and warrant further studies to optimize clinical responses.",

      "abstract": "Hemistepsin A is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from plants of the family. Recently, this compound was reported to be a bioactive compound that is beneficial for numerous health problems without side effects; however, its effect on lung cancer cells has not yet been studied. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of hemistepsin A in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. This study showed that treatment with hemistepsin A induces apoptosis by activating caspase cascade and reducing the expression of inhibitors of apoptotic protein family members. Additionally, hemistepsin A disrupted mitochondrial integration by altering the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins to increase the cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c. Moreover, hemistepsin A reduced the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, and pretreatment with a PI3K inhibitor markedly augmented the cytotoxic effect of hemistepsin A on A549 cells. Furthermore, hemistepsin A significantly enhanced the production of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas ROS scavengers restored the reduced viability by attenuating DNA damage and apoptosis by blocking the hemistepsin A-mediated inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Our findings demonstrate that hemistepsin A induces apoptosis in A549 cells by generating ROS, which subsequently inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting that ROS generation is involved as an early inducer of hemistepsin A-mediated anticancer activity.",

This study demonstrates that GRK5 inhibition induces ferroptosis and mitochondrial hyperpolarization, leading to impaired developmental capacity in porcine embryos. ABSTRACT: G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) regulates cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This study explored the effects of double-stranded RNA microinjection and inhibitor treatment (5 and 10 \u03bcM) to suppress GRK5 expression on porcine embryo development. GRK5 inhibition impaired blastocyst development and quality, elevated p53 expression, and induced ferroptosis by reducing solute carrier family 7 member 11 and glutathione peroxidase 4. It also promoted apoptosis by downregulating B-cell lymphoma extra-large and upregulating Bcl-2 associated X. Moreover, GRK5 inhibition enhanced glutaminolysis, leading to increased adenosine triphosphate levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and superoxide accumulation. Collectively, GRK5 inhibition increased p53 expression, induced apoptosis and ferroptosis, and promoted glutaminolysis, leading to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and impaired developmental capacity of porcine embryos.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a kidney complication associated with diabetes that can lead to renal failure. The dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor sitagliptin (SITA) has shown potential therapeutic benefits for DN. This study investigated the effect of SITA on DN, focusing on its modulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) signaling and its suppressive efficacy on inflammation and oxidative stress. Thirty-two male rats were divided into four groups: control, SITA-treated, diabetic, and SITA-treated diabetic rats. SITA was administered orally for 8\u00a0weeks to diabetic rats induced with streptozotocin, after which samples were collected for analysis. The results indicate that SITA effectively reduced hyperglycemia, weight loss, and kidney injury and fibrosis. SITA also decreased oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and apoptosis, as demonstrated by reductions in kidney malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide (NO), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3. These protective effects were associated with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap)-1 inhibition, increased levels of Nrf2 and FXR, and enhanced antioxidant activity as well as Bcl-2 upregulation. In silico analysis showed the binding of SITA with FXR, NF-\u03baB p65, iNOS, Keap-1, caspase-3, and HO-1. In conclusion, SITA mitigates DN by reducing hyperglycemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress, while enhancing antioxidant defenses, FXR and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.",

      "title": "Targeting the WSB2-NOXA axis in cancer cells for enhanced sensitivity to BCL-2 family protein inhibitors.",
      "abstract": "Anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins are frequently overexpressed in various cancers, playing a pivotal role in cancer initiation and progression, as well as intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. Although inhibitors targeting BCL-2, such as Venetoclax, have shown efficacy in hematological malignancies, their therapeutic potential in solid tumors remains limited. Identifying novel molecular targets to overcome resistance to these inhibitors is of significant clinical importance. Here, we provide evidence of a strong synthetic lethality between WSB2, a previously underexplored substrate-binding receptor of the Cullin 5-RBX2-Elongin B/C (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Mechanistically, WSB assembles a CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein. Loss of WSB2 leads to a substantial accumulation of NOXA in both cultured cell lines and knockout mouse tissues. While WSB2 deficiency alone does not significantly impact spontaneous apoptosis, it sensitizes cells to apoptosis when anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are either genetically depleted or pharmacologically inhibited. Moreover, WSB2 is overexpressed in several human cancer types. These findings identify WSB2 as a critical regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis and reveal the dysregulation of the WSB2-NOXA axis as a key factor contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancer cells. Targeting both WSB2 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins holds promising therapeutic potential for overcoming resistance in human cancers.",

In this study, a series of thiadiazole derivatives were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated for their anti-proliferative activity against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Among them, compound 7 exhibited superior cytotoxicity (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u20095.69\u202f\u00b5M for MDA-MB-231) and demonstrated remarkable selectivity over normal cell lines. It also displayed potent VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u20090.083\u202f\u00b5M), comparable to the reference drug sorafenib (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u20090.1 \u00b5M). Mechanistic studies revealed that compound 7 induces G2/M phase arrest and promotes late-stage apoptosis, supported by enhanced caspase-3 activation, Bax upregulation, and Bcl-2 suppression. Comprehensive computational analyses-including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations, ProLIF interaction mapping, and PCA studies-validated the stable and effective binding of compound 7 within the ATP-binding pocket of VEGFR-2. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the compound's high chemical stability and favorable electronic reactivity. Finally, in silico ADMET and toxicity predictions indicated favorable drug-likeness, low mutagenicity, and a high safety margin. Collectively, these findings position compound 7 as a potent and selective VEGFR-2 inhibitor, with promising therapeutic potential in breast cancer management and a strong foundation for further preclinical development.",
