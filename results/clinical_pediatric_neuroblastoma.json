          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alectinib is a widely used first-line ALK inhibitor for fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity, and its mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate how alectinib induces liver injury and to explore a potential protective strategy. METHODS: In vitro, AML-12\u00a0hepatocytes were incubated with alectinib to determine cell viability and morphology by using CCK-8 assay and optical microscopy, respectively. Necrosis was assessed by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Mitochondrial damage was analyzed by measuring membrane potential, ultrastructure, and respiratory chain complex activities using JC-1 staining under fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and assay kits, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using DCFH-DA staining and flow cytometry. Pyroptosis- and oxidative stress-related proteins (NLRP3, GSDMD-N, P20, cleaved IL-1\u03b2, Nrf2, HO-1) were quantified by Western blot. In vivo, C57BL/6J mice were divided into control, alectinib treatment, and alectinib plus magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) treatment groups. Serum ALT and AST were measured to assess liver function. Hepatic oxidative stress was evaluated by SOD and MDA levels. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by corresponding kits. Liver histopathology was examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: We found alectinib could induce the death of AML-12\u00a0hepatocytes. Alectinib impaired both the function and structure of mitochondria and caused a significant increase in ROS levels. The excessive accumulation of ROS triggered oxidative stress and finally resulted in cell pyroptosis in AML-12 cells. MgIG was found to alleviate mitochondrial damage and reduce ROS levels, restore the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress and pyroptosis caused by alectinib. CONCLUSION: Alectinib induces elevated ROS levels in hepatocytes by damaging mitochondria and causing oxidative stress in hepatocytes, which results in cell pyroptosis and ultimately hepatotoxicity, whereas MgIG can treat alectinib-induced hepatic injury by restoring mitochondrial function and structure.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms often appearing during childhood. Current approved long-term prophylaxis (LTP) for children aged <12 years require parenteral administration. Berotralstat is an oral, small-molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor, approved as prophylaxis of HAE attacks in patients aged \u226512 years. OBJECTIVE: APeX-P (NCT05453968), the largest trial of LTP in patients with HAE aged 2 to <12 years, evaluated oral berotralstat for the LTP of HAE in pediatric patients. METHODS: Before berotralstat initiation, patients received standard of care (SOC) for 12 weeks. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of berotralstat were assessed in a planned interim analysis. RESULTS: Median (range) age of patients (N=29) was 8.0 (3, 11) years, with 48.3% female. Median age at symptom onset was 2.0 years, and 82.8% of patients reported symptom onset before 6 years. Steady-state berotralstat median (range) Tmax was 3.9 hrs (0.9, 6.0) and geometric mean (coefficient of variation) Cmax was 204 ng/mL (40%) and AUC0-last was 915 ng\u2022hr/mL (42%). Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. There were no drug-related Grade 3/4 or serious AEs, deaths, or discontinuations related to AEs. Median (range) HAE attack rate during SOC was 0.96 (0, 5.0) attacks per 4-week period. Median (range) HAE attack rates for each 4-week period from Day 1 to Week 48 were 0 (Week 4: 0, 4.0; Week 48: 0, 1.7). CONCLUSION: Oral berotralstat was well tolerated and resulted in early and sustained reductions in HAE attack rates.",

          "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements have been identified as oncogenic drivers of multiple malignancies. Although at least three generations of ALK inhibitors have been developed, the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations remains a major barrier to drug efficacy. In this study, we develop a multiscale computational pipeline that combines hotspot residue identification, saturation mutagenesis screening, and alchemical free energy calculations to predict the impact of point mutations on the binding affinity of fourth-generation ALK inhibitors NVL-655 and TPX-0131. The hotspot residue analysis reveals that L1122, V1130, V1180, L1196, L1198, M1199, D1203, and L1256 contribute the most to ligand binding. A total of 9 and 13 mutations are identified as drug-resistant candidates with significantly decreased binding free energy of over 3\u202fkcal/mol for NVL-655 and TPX-0131, respectively. Specifically, V1180W, M1199W, and L1256S are the common mutations with decreased binding free energy concerning both inhibitors. These findings highlight important residues and mutations that may impact the clinical efficacy of NVL-655 and TPX-0131, and this pipeline provides an efficient and accurate framework to predict drug-resistant mutations and facilitate the rational design of next-generation ALK inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib, a third-generation Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), has demonstrated excellent curative effect in clinical studies to overcome mutations resistant to first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. It also has improved blood-brain barrier crossing and reduced brain metastases. METHODS: 44 patients were selected who received Lorlatinib as initial treatment for first-diagnosis ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or who received Lorlatinib as a back-line treatment after developing resistance with first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. The primary study endpoints are objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: For the 44 patients, the overall ORR[95% confidence intervals (CI)]was 59% (95% CI: 51-69), the DCR was 93% (95% CI: 36-56). In the first-line treatment group(n\u2009=\u200915), lorlatinib showned an ORR 93% (95% CI: 52-81), and the DCR was 100% (95% CI: 47-78). Additionally, 29 patients who received sequential Lorlatinib after progression on at least one first- or second-generation ALK-TKI showned an ORR of 41% (95% CI: 41-63) and a DCR of 90% (95% CI: 20-40). Lorlatinib demonstrated strong intracranial efficacay, with an overall intracranial objective response rate (IC-ORR) of 74% (95% CI: 67-92) and an intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) of 96% (95% CI: 53-81) in 23 patients with brain metastase. Among them, the IC-ORR and IC-DCR of 7 patients who received Lorlatinib as first-line therapy were both 100% (95% CI: 89-103). For 16 patients who had received at least one ALK-TKI, the IC-ORR with Lorlatinib was 63% (95% CI: 51-90), and the IC-DCR was 94% (95% CI: 27-70). 44 patients treated with Lorlatinib, all at a starting dose of 100\u00a0mg/day, 77% experienced adverse events, with the most common associated adverse event being hyperlipidaemia, However the overall grading was mild to moderate, with only one case of a reduction in dosage to 75\u00a0mg. CONCLUSIONS: This real-world evidence demonstrates that Lorlatinib exhibits significant clinical efficacy and intracranial anti-tumor activity in the treatment of ALK\u2009+\u2009NSCLC patients, whether in first-line or post-first-line treatment, while being well tolerated.",

          "abstract": "Protein hydrolysis-targeted chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional molecules designed for the selective degradation of target proteins. MS4078, a novel PROTAC, shows promise for treating ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet its clinical efficacy is hindered by suboptimal tumor targeting and off-target toxicities. To enhance its therapeutic profile, we developed human heavy chain ferritin (HFN) as a targeted delivery system, leading to the creation of HFN@MS4078 nanocages. Prepared via passive loading, HFN@MS4078 achieved a drug loading capacity of 178 molecules per nanocage with a HFN recovery rate of 70.1\u202f%. The nanocages exhibited a rapid release profile under lysosomal conditions (pH 5.0), with approximately 80\u202f% drug release after 60\u202fh, while maintaining over 80\u202f% stability at physiological pH 7.4. In vitro, HFN@MS4078 was actively internalized into lysosomes via TfR1 receptor binding, resulting in a 2.7-2.8 times reduction in IC values compared to free MS4078. Furthermore, HFN@MS4078 significantly decreased the expression levels of ALK, p-ALK, p-AKT, and p-ERK in NCI-H2228 and NCI-H3122 cell lines. In vivo, HFN@MS4078 substantially reduced tumor volume and prolonged survival while exhibiting negligible systemic toxicity. These results suggest that HFN@MS4078 represents a promising strategy for targeted therapy in ALK-positive NSCLC, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Brigatinib and alectinib are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) approved in China in 2022 and 2018, respectively, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive, advanced non\u2011small\u2011cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study is to conduct a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of first-line drugs, brigatinib and alectinib, in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states was used to simulate the health outcomes and costs of brigatinib and alectinib with a 30-year time horizon. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) data were used to obtain the comparative efficacy of brigatinib and alectinib, owing to lack of head-to-head trials. As the health benefits were comparable between brigatinib and alectinib on the basis of the ITCs, cost-minimization analysis (CMA) was conducted. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) were also conducted as scenario analyses using the different point estimates from the ITCs. Health state utilities and costs were obtained from public sources or clinical expert opinion. Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for the CMA. RESULTS: The CMA showed that, over 30\u00a0years, brigatinib (63,539 USD) was associated with cost savings of 14,203 USD compared with alectinib (77,742 USD). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that drug costs were the most influential parameter but brigatinib remained cost-saving in all the analyses. In the CEAs, the total cost of brigatinib was lower in all scenarios and also resulted in higher QALYs in 60% of the CEA scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Brigatinib was a cost-saving (14,203 USD) treatment compared with alectinib in the CMA analysis for the first-line treatment of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in China.",

          "abstract": "HexaBody-CD27 (GEN1053/BNT313) is an investigational novel agonistic CD27 antibody engineered to enhance T-cell costimulation and promote antitumor immunity. Through the introduction of a hexamerization-enhancing mutation in the IgG Fc domain, HexaBody-CD27 was designed to drive clustering and activation of CD27 via intermolecular Fc:Fc interactions between membrane-bound antibodies, independent of crosslinking by Fc\u03b3R-bearing cells. HexaBody-CD27 carries an Fc-silencing mutation to prevent T-cell depletion through Fc-mediated effector functions.\u00a0In vitro, HexaBody-CD27 induced CD27 receptor signaling independent of Fc\u03b3R-mediated crosslinking in a reporter assay. It also enhanced T-cell proliferation, cytotoxic activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in primary human lymphocytes. In contrast to benchmark IgG1 CD27 antibodies, HexaBody-CD27 did not induce phagocytosis of T cells in vitro. HexaBody-CD27 promoted ex vivo tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) expansion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, in particular of CD8 TILs. The combination of HexaBody-CD27 with an anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced T-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity in vitro compared to either compound alone. In conclusion, HexaBody-CD27 enhanced T-cell activation and effector functions in an Fc\u03b3R-crosslinking-independent manner, without inducing T-cell depletion. The immune agonist activity of HexaBody-CD27 was potentiated in combination with PD-1 blockade.",

          "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor of the RTK insulin superfamily, was named after its initial identification in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Following a reciprocal chromosomal translocation with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), ALK protein is abnormally expressed, promoting the malignant transformation of T cells into a more aggressive lymphoma. The inhibition of ALK activity could therefore benefit ALK+ ALCL patients. Despite the market availability and success of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), real-world ALK+ ALCL patients exhibit significant heterogeneity in terms of disease stage at first diagnosis, tumor progression, and responses to medication. This indicates a need for more detailed differentiation of ALK+ ALCL patients in clinical practice. Here, we discovered that apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-reduction/oxidation factor 1 (APE1/REF1), an interacting partner of NPM1, could stabilize NPM1-ALK fusion protein oligomers and enhance ALK tumor-promoting activity and growth, decreasing cell sensitivity to ALK-TKIs. Our results also reveal that disruption of the interaction weakens cell growth and augments the therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib and alectinib, ALK-TKIs, against ALK+ ALCL. Thus, high expression of APE1 indicates a faster growth of ALK+ ALCL; targeting this interaction may potentially achieve improved therapeutic outcomes, providing a reference for more precise treatment of ALK+ ALCL patients in clinical practice.",

We identified a rare case of ALK-positive histiocytosis with fusion of the ALK gene with TFG. A 35-year-old previously healthy male has been complaining of back and hip discomfort for seven months. A radiologic examination of the spine and pelvis revealed several hypermetabolic osteolytic lesions. Immunostaining for LCA, CD68, CD117and ALK were positive, whereas immunostaining for CD1a, Langerin, and S100 were negative. Analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed the fusion of the TFG and ALK genes. After receiving alectinib, an ALK inhibitor of the second generation, the patient showed a durable remission. ALK-positive histiocytosis is a distinct form of histiocytosis that has the potential to be treated with an ALK inhibitor.",

          "abstract": "In total, >90 unique anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement fusion partners have been identified, each with a unique sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, rendering targeted therapy challenging. In the present study, the efficacy of alectinib in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harbouring a novel ALK-microtubule-associated tumour suppressor candidate 2 (MTUS2) fusion and a rare Striatin 3 (STRN3)-ALK fusion was assessed. A 20-year-old non-smoker was hospitalised with a persistent cough. Subsequent positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed a tumour in the right lower lobe, with mediastinal, hilar, lymph node and bone metastases. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging also revealed a cerebral metastasis. Bronchoscopic biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe nodule, resulting in a clinical stage IVB diagnosis (cT2bN3bM1c). Targeted next-generation sequencing of tissue and blood samples revealed ALK-MTUS2 and STRN3-ALK fusions. The patient was treated with alectinib as the first-line therapy and a durable partial response was achieved after 3 months, with disappearance of the brain metastases. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first discovery of simultaneous ALK-MTUS2 and STRN3-ALK fusions. The clinical outcome offers potential therapeutic options for patients with rare ALK rearrangements and underscores the necessity for further research on the functions of these fusions.",

In pediatric patients, the majority of cases are Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-positive. Despite intensive multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, treatment failure rates remain at 25-30%. Recent advancements in targeted therapies, notably ALK inhibitors and the anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin, have demonstrated substantial activity in relapsed and refractory settings. Molecular detection of minimal disseminated disease (MDD) and minimal residual disease (MRD) offer improved prognostic stratification. For patients with relapsed or refractory disease, targeted therapies have increased treatment options, but more work needs to be done to define optimal treatment regimens, duration, and need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in this group. Immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy provide additional therapeutic options. Incorporating targeted therapies and MDD/MRD assessments into clinical trials could significantly improve outcomes for pediatric and adolescent patients with ALCL.",

These attacks may involve immune and inflammatory mechanisms. We compared serum biomarkers indicating vascular integrity, leakage, angiogenesis, coagulation, and inflammation. During an attack-free period, we assessed 34 markers simultaneously using multi- and/or singleplex ELISA in 25 patients with C1-INH-HAE, 17 with ACEi-AE, 25 with Hist-AE, and 23 healthy controls. Differential blood counts, C1-INH-HAE-specific laboratory parameters, and recently developed assays addressing early complement and lectin pathways were included. The results revealed significant differences, as well as some similarities. Tie-2, VEGFs, C1s/C1INHc appear to play a role in all AE types regardless of whether they are bradykinin- or histamine-mediated. Furthermore, evidence was found for a role of IL-17, eosinophil, and neutrophil chemotactic factors, and the activation of these granulocytes was found. MASP-1/C1-INHc indicated early activation of the lectin pathway in ACEi-AE and HistAE, but not in C1-INH-HAE. C1s/C1-INHc and MASP-1/C1INHc ratio was able to discriminate C1-INH-HAE from controls and the other AE types. Future investigations in C1-INH-HAE, ACEi-AE, and Hist-AE should not only focus on complement activation but also the interaction with granulocytes.",

          "abstract": "The study investigated the potential of nano-formulated orientin (NF-O) in the anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. Orientin is a flavonoid that has a promising effect against anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-arrhythmia properties. Nano-formulation aimed to overcome this limitation and also served to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. In silico docking studies, the favorable binding of orientin was identified with the key oncogenic targets (EGFR, ALK, KRAS, NTRK). After nano-formulation, UV spectroscopy confirmed the integrity of orientin with no shift in the \u03bbmax (347\u2009nm). Dynamic light scattering showed a significant reduction in the improved particle size (PDI decreased from 0.863 to 0.173) by nano-formulation from 559\u2009nm to 220\u2009nm. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the nano-formulation process did not alter the chemical structure of orientin. In-vitro studies using MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that NF-O inhibited cell growth and reduced viability in a dose-dependent manner. At 10 \u00b5M, NF-O significantly inhibited the cell growth and migration compared to the control and native orientin in wound healing assays (p\u2009<\u20090.01). In ova, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, NF-O (10 \u00b5g/ml) significantly inhibited angiogenesis by reducing blood vessel density, branching, length, and network formation compared to controls and native orientin. These findings suggest that NF-O holds significant promise as a novel anti-angiogenic agent for the cancer treatment.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK-rearrangement. Ceritinib, a clinically approved ALK inhibitor, is associated with some adverse reactions, including organizing pneumonia (OP). However, few cases of ceritinib-induced OP have been reported to date. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old female patient with ALK\u2009+\u2009lung adenocarcinoma presented with paroxysmal cough lasting 3\u00a0months. Antibiotic therapy was not effective, and blood and sputum cultures were negative. DIAGNOSIS: A computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the left upper lung was performed and hematoxylin-eosin staining was consistent with OP. The diagnosis of ceritinib-induced OP was considered based on these results. INTERVENTIONS: Ceritinib was then stopped, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone (40\u00a0mg ivgtt qd) for one week. The dose was lowered to 32\u00a0mg po qd with regular follow-up. Later, the patient switched to another ALK inhibitor, ensartinib, for treatment, and the steroid was discontinued after two months. OUTCOMES: A Chest CT scan after one week of treatment showed progressive disappearance of lung lesions, and the patient was discharged on oral methylprednisolone (32\u00a0mg qd) for two weeks after which the dose was reduced gradually. CONCLUSION: OP should be considered when new lesions appear in the lungs of lung cancer patients, and distinguished from infectious pneumonia, metastasis, or cancer progression. In this respect, pathological biopsy plays an important role in diagnosis. In our case, discontinuation of ceritinib and regular steroid administration were effective.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ALK inhibitors for ALK fusion-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), drug resistance remains a challenge. Studies of treatment outcomes and resistance biomarkers are imperative for drug development, yet patient representation can be limited. This study evaluated the feasibility of a decentralized research infrastructure to establish a clinical and biospecimen repository, broadening patient access and inclusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC across the U.S. were enrolled through remote informed consent. Clinical history and tumor molecular profiling data were collected at baseline and during remote follow-ups. Archival tumor and saliva biospecimens (for germline sampling) were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: Of 87 eligible patients, 80 (92%) completed remote consent and enrolled. Clinical data collection rate was 100%, with archival tumor acquired from 80% and saliva samples from 65%. Patients represented 31 states, with 94% residing outside the study center's state and 90% receiving care elsewhere. Next-generation sequencing was conducted on 55 treatment-na\u00efve and 18 treatment-resistant biopsies, all of whom received at least one prior second-generation ALK inhibitor and nine received lorlatinib. ALK resistance mutations were identified in 54% of treatment-resistant biopsies; other commonly co-altered genes included TP53 (18%) and CDKN2A/B (16%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the feasibility of a decentralized design to enhance the inclusion of a broader patient population with ALK+ NSCLC. This establishes a scalable framework that may help overcome barriers to patient participation in research, with the goal of improving therapy development and patient outcomes. The ENIGMA+ study accrual and analysis continue (NCT04881916).",

          "title": "Utility of serum CYFRA 21-1 as a prognostic biomarker in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer treated with ALK-TKIs: a retrospective cohort study.",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 3-7% of all cases and causes oncogene addiction. Although ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) are effective for treating ALK-positive NSCLC, some patients still show suboptimal responses and poor outcomes. Clinically simple and detectable biomarkers for this group are limited. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1 and CYFRA) are widely used tumor markers in NSCLC. Elevated CEA levels are linked to tumor progression and resistance to cell death, while CYFRA is widely expressed in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. CYFRA has been identified as a prognostic factor in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive NSCLC, but its role in ALK-positive NSCLC remains unclear. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed the value of CEA and CYFRA as predictive biomarkers in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC treated with ALK-TKIs. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 197 patients with advanced or recurrent ALK-positive NSCLC, who were diagnosed across 13 institutions in Japan and received their first ALK-TKI between July 1, 2014 and December 31, 2022. Eligible patients had measurable lesions based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Patients were stratified based on normal (\u22645.0 and \u22643.5 ng/mL) or high (>5.0 and >3.5 ng/mL) baseline serum CEA and CYFRA levels. Serum CYFRA and CEA levels, which were measured using commercially available immunoassays per standard institutional protocols. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) with initial ALK-TKI therapy, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 152 patients with available CYFRA data, 91 (59.9%) had normal CYFRA levels and 61 (40.1%) had elevated levels. In this analysis, patients in the high CYFRA group had significantly shorter median PFS and OS (9.27 and 28.8 months, respectively) than those in the normal CYFRA group (42.0 and 143.3 months, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high CYFRA levels were independent predictors of poor PFS (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.50-3.68, P<0.001) and OS (HR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.89-5.70, P<0.001). Furthermore, the high CYFRA group had lower ORR and complete response (CR) rates, compared with the normal CYFRA group. In contrast, no significant differences in PFS or OS were observed between patients with normal and elevated CEA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CYFRA levels correlate with reduced PFS and OS in ALK-positive NSCLC, indicating potential as a prognostic biomarker. Given CYFRA's association with tumor heterogeneity, which reduces ALK-TKI efficacy, its assessment could aid in risk stratification and treatment planning. Additional research is needed to verify the predictive value of CYFRA for ALK-TKI efficacy.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant anaplastic lymphoma kinase () rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an unmet need. Among these patients, the efficacy of immunotherapy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with ALK-TKI-resistant NSCLC, stratified by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of advanced NSCLC patients with -rearrangement, who were treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy after the development of ALK-TKI resistance at the Shanghai Chest Hospital. Progression-free survival (PFS) was used to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: The final analysis included 89 patients between June 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, who met the selection criteria. The entire cohort had a median follow-up time of 33.4 months. The patients who received immunotherapy had better PFS than those who received non-immunotherapy (median PFS: 5.3  2.5 months; P=0.009). The PD-L1-positive patients who received immunotherapy had a median PFS of 7.1 months, while those who received non-immunotherapy had a median PFS of 2.5 months (P=0.02). No such statistically significant difference was observed in the PD-L1-negative patients (median PFS for with immunotherapy  without immunotherapy: 1.5  2.9 months; P=0.68). The PD-L1-positive patients who underwent re-biopsy after the development of TKI resistance and who received immunotherapy had a PFS of 7.8 months, while those who received non-immunotherapy had a PFS of 2.7 months (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first real-world retrospective study to show that some patients with positive PD-L1 expression may benefit from immune-based therapy after the development of ALK-TKI resistance. However, we still recommend biopsy for patients who develop ALK-TKI resistance to provide further treatment guidance.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies, with poor drug response and high mortality rates. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy, leveraging E3 ligases to degrade oncogenic proteins selectively via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These degraders offer higher selectivity and bioavailability compared to traditional inhibitors. This review explores how PROTACs eliminate oncogenic proteins in lung cancer and examines the role of E3 ligases in this process. Commonly utilized ligases include Cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), while newer ones, such as MDM2 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), are being investigated for therapeutic potential. We discuss key factors in PROTAC design, including ligand selection, linker optimization, and pharmacokinetic properties, which influence tumor specificity and efficacy while minimizing off- target effects. Additionally, we highlight targetable oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, such as KRAS, EGFR, and ALK fusion proteins, and evaluate preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate PROTACs' potential for overcoming drug resistance. The challenges associated with clinical translation, tumor microenvironment interactions, and E3 ligase selection are also discussed. Finally, we present future perspectives, including expanding the range of E3 ligases, developing multitargeting strategies, and integrating next-generation molecular glue degraders. By offering a comparative analysis of E3 ligase- specific PROTACs, this review underscores the potential of PROTAC technology to advance precision oncology in lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "The abundance of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) is correlated with malignant tumor progression. PGCCs divide asymmetrically to generate daughter cells with high invasive and migratory capacities. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which the overexpression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) regulates the migration and invasion of PGCCs and their daughter cells (PDCs). In the present study, PGCC formation was induced by CoCl in Hct116 and LoVo cells. The mRNA expression and protein levels were detected using reverse transcription\u2012quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. The regulatory relationships among related proteins were determined via small molecule inhibitors, transient small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, and coimmunoprecipitation. Our findings indicated that CoCl induces PGCC formation and produces progeny cells with increased invasive and metastatic abilities. PLK1 was expressed in PDCs and showed altered subcellular localization. In addition, aurora kinase A (AURKA) activated PLK1 by phosphorylating it at serine 137 and threonine 210. Activated PLK1 first stabilizes \u03b2-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and subsequently promotes its entry into the nucleus. After entering the nucleus, \u03b2-catenin promotes the accumulation of the tyrosine 705 site of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3-Tyr705), which promotes the downstream expression of target proteins, such as cyclin D1, matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) and c-MYC, and EMT-associated proteins as transcription factors. Furthermore, STAT3 and PLK1 form a feedback loop, allowing STAT3 to regulate PLK1 expression. In conclusion, PLK1 phosphorylation at different sites regulates the transcriptional function of pSTAT3-Tyr705 by promoting \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation. Furthermore, AURKA and STAT3 affected PLK1 expression.",

          "abstract": "Targeting Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) to modulate RalA activation offers a promising strategy for tumor suppression in Ras-independent and Ras-dependent cancers. However, clinical use of the AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 (Alisertib) is limited by its hydrophobicity and poor water solubility. To overcome these limitations, here, we developed an enzyme-biodegradable unimolecular micelle (UMM) nanoparticle to deliver MLN8237 (NP) and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in tumor xenograft models. NP selectively inhibited AURKA, downregulated pSer194 RalA, and suppressed anchorage-independent growth in SKOV3 (Ras-independent) and MIA PaCa-2 (Ras-dependent) cancer cells. Nanoparticles loaded with sulforhodamine B (NP) and IR780 (NP) confirmed enhanced cellular uptake and tumor localization, respectively. Improved solubility and bioavailability enabled low-dose parenteral delivery of MLN8237, achieving significant tumor regression compared to free drug. This correlated with inhibition of AURKA and RalA phosphorylation (pSer194RalA) in both tumors. Together, they highlight the therapeutic potential of NP in targeting AURKA-RalA crosstalk in tumor xenografts.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is aberrantly expressed in a large number of tumors and promotes tumor progression by regulating the cell cycle, chromosomal instability, and drug resistance. However, its heterogeneous expression and combination therapy benefit in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is unclear. METHODS: In this study, we integrated TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data and GEO data to analyze the RNA, methylation, protein expression, and genomic alteration characteristics of AURKA. We then used single-cell RNA sequencing to resolve the functional heterogeneity of AURKA in the PRAD epithelial cell subpopulation and verified its impact on the malignant phenotype of desmoplasia-resistant prostate cancer cells in in vitro experiments. This research also analyzed the prognostic risk stratification of AURKA subpopulations in combination with various indicators and the potential benefit of AURKA inhibitors in combination with various treatments. RESULTS: The pan-cancer analysis demonstrated that AURKA expression heterogeneity was present among urological tumors at different molecular levels, and the positive correlation of AURKA alteration with MYC and E2F pathways was conserved in pan-cancer. Epithelial cell subpopulations with high expression of AURKA (epi3/4/6) promoted proliferation by regulating cell cycle and DNA repair, while low expression subsets (epi1/2/7) activated TNF-\u03b1 and androgen receptor (AR) pathways to mediate drug resistance. In particular, AURKA may serve as a compensatory pathway to support tumor activity after AR inhibition in prostate cancer, a complex mechanism not seen in other tumors. AURKA-overexpressing patients with low Gleason scores or high PSA have a poor prognosis in clinical analysis. Furthermore, a comprehensive drug sensitivity co-analysis found that AURKA inhibitors may benefit from targeted therapy, ADC therapy, and immunotherapy. TMB and CD274 expression were the biomarkers of AURKA high-expression patients with PRAD for clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: AURKA expression heterogeneity has been identified as a critical factor in the progression of PRAD and the development of drug resistance. The molecular subtyping of AURKA can serve as a precise strategy for combination therapy and provide a theory for the combination of AURKA inhibitors and targeted/immunotherapy.",

We aim to identify novel biomarkers for BLCA and elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screened from GSE38264 and GSE130598 datasets, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks to identify hub genes, whose expression was validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The malignant phenotype of BLCA cells was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, Transwell, and wound-healing assays. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining were employed to evaluate BLCA development in mouse xenograft models. The protein expression was detected by Western blot. PLK1, AURKA, AURKB, CDK1, ERBB2, ERBB3, FGFR1, FYN, ABL1, and PRKDC were hub genes with predictive value for BLCA. Among them, PLK1 was selected as a key target of BLCA. PLK1 knockdown inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of BLCA cells. In vivo, PLK1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth. Silencing PLK1 activated the Hippo pathway in BLCA cells and tumor tissues. The Hippo pathway inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effects of PLK1 silencing on malignant phenotype of BLCA cells. PLK1 knockdown exerts an inhibitory effect on BLCA via activating the Hippo pathway, which presents promising therapeutic strategies for BLCA.",

          "abstract": "In colorectal cancer,  and  are major mutation points in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. These gene mutations are known to be important causes of resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapies. Recently, it has been reported that Aurora kinase A (AURKA), one of the mitotic kinases, interacts with the EGFR-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. In this study, we examined whether the combination of MK-5108 (AURKA inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) enhanced the antitumor effect for colon cancer cell lines. The combination of MK-5108 and trametinib showed synergistic enhancements of antitumor effect in three colon cancer cell lines harboring  or  mutation. Cell cycle analysis showed induction of G2/M and G1 arrests by MK-5108 and trametinib, respectively, and the potential enhancement of G1 arrest with the two drug combination. The addition of MK-5108 to trametinib enhanced the suppression of -ERK and other G1/S progression-related proteins expression. In HCT116\u00a0cells, harboring wild-type , the combination therapy induced more potent cell proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction than in  knockout cells. These were related to potential enhancement of p53 expression and caspase activation. In conclusion, the combination of MK-5108 and trametinib may synergistically inhibit tumor cell division with or without  mutation, and with either  or  mutation. Furthermore, the combination therapy could be more effective in wild-type \u00a0cells.",

          "title": "Covalent Inhibition of the Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 by Sulfopin Results in a Broad Impact on the Phosphoproteome of Human Osteosarcoma U2-OS Cells.",
          "abstract": "Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, NIMA-interacting protein 1-(Pin1) catalyses the cis-trans interconversion of the inflexible bond between serine or threonine residues and proline at the +1 position (pSer/pThr-Pro). Although initially discovered as an essential regulator of cell division, Pin1 has since been identified as a regulator of many biological processes and is associated with numerous malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders. Pin1 has been shown to influence phosphorylation by modulating phosphatase accessibility. However, it can also indirectly regulate phosphorylation by isomerizing peptidyl-prolyl bonds on kinases, affecting their subcellular localization and/or substrate specificity. Here, SILAC-based mass spectrometry was employed to identify proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in human osteosarcoma human osteosarcoma cell line (U2-OS) cells in response to treatment with the selective covalent Pin1 inhibitor Sulfopin. We confirmed that Sulfopin covalently binds Pin1 and profiled Pin1-dependent changes to the proteome and phosphoproteome, identifying 803 phosphosites that underwent significant Sulfopin-dependent changes. The identified phosphosites include substrates for a number of distinct kinases, including protein kinase B (AKT1), aurora kinase A (AURKA), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CK2. Overall, this study reveals the broad impact of Sulfopin on the phosphoproteome, improving our understanding of how Pin1 modulates complex regulatory kinase networks in living cells. SUMMARY: The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) Pin1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for numerous malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders based on its altered expression in several diseases. As the activity of Pin1 is phosphorylation-dependent, it is intimately involved with constituents of regulatory kinase networks within cells. To elucidate how Pin1 orchestrates regulatory signalling within cells, we performed quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of SILAC-labelled human osteosarcoma U2-OS cells treated with Sulfopin, a highly selective covalent Pin1 inhibitor. In addition to demonstrating that Pin1 inhibition alters the abundance and phosphorylation of proteins involved in a variety of fundamental cellular processes, these studies revealed that Pin1 inhibition modulates the phosphorylation of 803 phosphorylation sites, ultimately improving our understanding of how a PPIase regulates phosphorylation networks in complex biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Aurora kinase A (AURKA) plays critical roles in the cell cycle. Its oncogenic functions have been identified in various types of cancer. However, its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been extensively explored. Alisertib, a selective AURKA inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of alisertib and elucidate its molecular mechanisms in AML cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted using western blotting and immunocytochemistry, respectively, to identify the effects of alisertib on two AML cell lines (KG-1 and MOLM-13). Primary cells from three patients with AML were used to examine the response to alisertib treatment. The results showed alisertib significantly reduced Thr288 phosphorylation of AURKA in both KG-1 and MOLM-13 cell lines. Interestingly, it selectively inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705, but not at Ser727. Notably, alisertib significantly decreased interleukin-6-induced nuclear pTyr705-STAT3 levels after short-term treatment, while also affecting the expression of downstream c-Myc. In addition to these in vitro findings, in vivo xenograft model using KG-1 cells showed significant tumor growth retardation accompanied by pTyr705-STAT3 inhibition following alisertib treatment. In primary AML patient cells, we observed a consistent trend in the alisertib-induced reduction of pTyr705-STAT3 and cell growth inhibition. In conclusion, AURKA and alisertib are promising therapeutic targets and treatment options for AML.",

          "abstract": "Aurora kinases, AURKA, AURKB, and AURKC, are serine/threonine kinases that play a vital role in regulating cell division and mitosis, particularly in the separation of chromosomes. These kinases are often overexpressed in human tumor cell lines, indicating their potential involvement in tumorigenesis. Preliminary evidence supports the use of Aurora kinase inhibitors for certain types of tumors, several AURKs inhibitors are currently under phase I and II trials. As a result, there is a growing interest in identifying small-molecule Aurora kinase inhibitors to develop as anti-cancer agents. The regulation of the cell cycle, including mitosis, is increasingly recognized as a key target in the fight against various forms of cancer. Novel drugs are being designed to inhibit the function of regulatory proteins, such as Aurora kinases, with the goal of creating personalized treatments. This review summarizes the biology of Aurora kinases in the context of cancer, integrating both preclinical and clinical data. It discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with using Aurora kinases to enhance cancer treatment. Future directions for Aurora kinase-based therapies include developing more selective inhibitors that minimize off-target effects and improve therapeutic efficacy. Researchers are also exploring combination therapies that use Aurora kinase inhibitors alongside other targeted treatments to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, advancements in biomarker discovery are expected to facilitate the identification of patients most likely to benefit from Aurora kinase-targeted therapies, paving the way for more personalized approaches to cancer treatment.",

However, clinical trials have indicated modest monotherapy activity of AURKA inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that AURKA inhibition promotes phosphorylation of Replication Protein A (RPA), resulting in stalled DNA replication fork progression and eliciting a replication stress response in multiple  -mutated models, creating a druggable dependence on the mitotic checkpoint kinase WEE1. Combined inhibition of AURKA and WEE1 synergistically enhanced replication stress, tumor-specific apoptotic cell death, and mitotic catastrophe, and lead to marked tumor regression in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models of  -mutated cancer. Our findings define enhanced DNA replication stress as underlying the strong synergy between AURKA and WEE1 inhibitors and offer preclinical confirmation of efficacy, indicating high potential for clinical translation of this synthetic lethal strategy for  -mutated carcinomas.

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Uveal melanoma (UM) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, where angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in tumor metastasis. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is widely recognized for its role in regulating cell cycle progression and promoting tumorigenesis; however, its involvement in UM-associated angiogenesis remains largely unexplored. Artesunate (ART), a bioactive compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, has recently garnered attention for its promising anti-cancer properties. This study aimed to elucidate the role of AURKA in UM angiogenesis and assess the potential of ART as an effective AURKA inhibitor. METHODS: The TCGA database was utilized to investigate AURKA expression and its prognostic significance in UM. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression and nomogram modeling were applied to assess its prognostic value. The impact of AURKA on angiogenesis in UM was assessed through HUVECs tube formation, migration and CAM assays in vitro. WB experiments were performed to explore the mechanisms by which AURKA regulated angiogenesis. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were used to investigate the binding sites and binding affinity of ART on AURKA. Finally, experiments in vivo using a nude mouse xenograft model were performed to confirm the effects of ART and knocking down AURKA on tumor growth and angiogenesis. RESULTS: High AURKA expression was associated with poor clinical prognosis in UM patients. AURKA promoted angiogenesis via activation of the JAK2/STAT3/VEGFA pathway. ART formed stable hydrogen bonds with AURKA and inhibited its pro-angiogenic effects. In experiments in vivo, ART combined with knocking down AURKA significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and decreased the levels of the angiogenesis marker CD31 and the proliferation marker Ki67. CONCLUSIONS: AURKA promoted UM progression by driving angiogenesis through the JAK2/STAT3/VEGFA signaling pathway. ART effectively inhibited the function of AURKA, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for UM. The synergistic effects of ART and knocking down AURKA further highlighted its potential as a novel anti-angiogenic therapy for UM.",

They play important roles in driving an oncogenic transformation of cancer cells by regulating their survival and proliferation, mainly because of the kinases' mitotic activity. Aurora kinase inhibitors (AKIs) were developed and tested in clinical trials and effectively suppressed many cancer types, suggesting the potential for Aurora kinases as a novel therapeutic target. Aurora kinase inhibition has also been well-documented to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness in various cancers. However, not all cancer types respond to AKIs, and the mechanisms behind the resistance are still elusive. This review will first briefly summarize the gene expression, regulation, and substrates of the Aurora Kinases, describe the function of Aurora kinases in mitosis, and then review the Aurora kinases' oncogenic roles in different cancer types as well as tumorigenesis, including cancer metabolism and anti-tumor immune evasion. In addition, we recapped the recent studies that revealed the critical role of Aurora Kinases in various cancer therapies and discussed the clinical outcomes of AKIs in combination with other types of therapies. Furthermore, we reviewed the current development of a new generation of AKI, such as PROTAC degrader. Further understanding the mechanism underlying the responsiveness of AKIs could help evaluate their effect and improve them as potential therapeutic targets.",

Natural products, particularly fungal-derived metabolites from the genus , represent promising candidates due to their diverse biological activities. Although previous studies have indicated the anticancer potential of  species, systematic characterization of their molecular targets has been limited. This study aimed to comprehensively identify and evaluate  metabolites as potential multitarget anticancer agents through a network pharmacology approach.  A total of 129 metabolites previously reported in the literature from polar aqueous, alcoholic, and non-polar extracts of  were compiled and chemically classified using ChemMine tools. Structure-based target prediction and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to investigate their potential biological targets. Predicted molecular targets were cross-referenced with differentially expressed genes in breast, colorectal, and lung cancers to identify hub proteins. Molecular docking simulations were conducted to assess binding affinities of metabolites to key oncogenic targets, and SwissADME was utilized for pharmacokinetic profiling.  The analysis revealed that  metabolites targeted critical oncogenic pathways, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and apoptosis. Hub proteins such as TYMS, AURKA, and CDK1 were identified as primary targets. Docking simulations highlighted metabolites such as cordycepsidone A, jiangxienone, and flazin, demonstrating binding affinities comparable or superior to clinically used inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic profiling identified several metabolites with favorable drug-like properties, supporting their potential as lead compounds.  extracts contain structurally diverse metabolites capable of modulating multiple cancer-relevant molecular targets, providing a robust foundation for their development into multitarget anticancer therapies. This integrative network pharmacology approach underscores the potential of fungal metabolites in oncology drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "Overexpression and activation of kinases often results in cancer initiation and progression through both catalytic and non-catalytic functions that promote rapid proliferation, growth, survival, and metastasis of cells. Catalytic functions are effectively blocked with the use of ATP-competitive inhibitors, however drug-resistant mutations are emerging all the time. Further, single-agent ATP-competitive inhibitors sometimes fail to eliminate oncogenic properties of the targeted kinase, likely due to (non-targeted) non-catalytic functions that are maintained. Non-catalytic functions - such as scaffolding roles, where the kinase may interact with other proteins to coordinate cellular activities or protect them from degradation by the proteasome - may be targeted through the development of protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors, although this is a highly challenging endeavour. To overcome the limitations of classical (ATP-competitive) inhibitors (and circumvent the formidable feat required in the development of PPI inhibitors), which operate through \"occupancy-driven\" pharmacology, targeted protein degradation, as showcased by proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), is fast becoming a highly sought-after goal for a large plethora of protein targets, and is governed by \"event-driven\" pharmacology. Because PROTACs result in the degradation of the protein of interest, these compounds are predicted to both catalytic and non-catalytic functions of a targeted kinase. Herein, we focus on the development of PROTACs that target (i) the scaffolding roles of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that are associated with the formation of signaling units involved in migration and invasion events and (ii) the scaffolding roles of Aurora-A kinase (AURKA), which play a role in the protection of MYC proteins from proteasomal degradation.",

Previous attempts to inhibit PLK4 have been hampered by selectivity or ADME liabilities. The known inhibitor Centrinone B, while potent and selective, is metabolically unstable and lacks oral bioavailability. Assisted by structure-based drug design (SBDD), dramatic improvements in potency, selectivity and ADME properties were made to this structure, resulting in the identification of RP-1664, a potent inhibitor of PLK4 with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in preclinical species. Kinome profiling demonstrated exquisite selectivity over related kinases, including AURKA/B and PLK1. RP-1664 disrupts centriole biogenesis in cancer cells, modulates pharmacodynamic readouts of PLK4 activity in xenograft tumor tissues, and is efficacious in multiple -amplified xenograft models.

          },
          "abstract": "Chemical modification of mRNA regulates its stability and translation efficiency. The most prevalent modification is the N-methyladenosine (mA) modification. YT521-B homology domain-containing proteins (YTHDCs) are \"reader\" proteins of mA modification and contribute to various cell functions by regulating their target mA-containing mRNAs. Although mA modification dynamically changes throughout the cell cycle, the role of the mA pathway in cell division remains unclear. In this study, we found that YTHDC1, one of the YTHDCs, is important for cell division. Mitotic progression is delayed in YTHDC1-knockdown cells, and the mitotic delay is mitigated by the re-expression of wild-type YTHDC1, indicating the YTHDC1 function in mitotic progression. Time-lapse imaging analysis showed that prolonged mitotic duration caused by YTHDC1 knockdown is due to the retardation of chromosome alignment and segregation. Treatment of AZ3146, an inhibitor of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), mitigates the mitotic delay in YTHDC1-knockdown cells, suggesting that YTHDC1 knockdown results in SAC activation, leading to a slowdown of mitotic progression. Furthermore, increased TPX2 protein expression and the subsequent overabundance of Aurora A at the centrosomes is partly involved in YTHDC1 knockdown-induced mitotic delay. Since YTHDC1 knockdown does not affect the TPX2 mRNA level and the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment impairs the YTHDC1-knockdown effect on the TPX2 protein level, YTHDC1 may post-transcriptionally regulate the TPX2 expression. Considering that TPX2 or Aurora A overexpression causes mitotic failure, these results suggest that YTHDC1 contributes to mitotic progression partly through the precise regulation of TPX2-Aurora A signaling.",

          "abstract": "The dysregulation of mitotic kinases, particularly Microtubule Associated Serine/Threonine Kinase Like (MASTL) and Aurora A kinase, play pivotal roles in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Herein, we report cyclohexa[b]thiophenes as first-in-class dual inhibitors of MASTL and Aurora A kinase. The lead compound, MA4, demonstrated potent inhibition of both kinases with IC values of 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM for Aurora A and 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0\u03bcM for MASTL. Kinase selectivity profiling against a panel of 277 kinases revealed a high degree of specificity against both targets. In vitro antiproliferative screening using the NCI-60 human cancer cell line panel revealed broad-spectrum cytotoxicity, with MA4 exhibiting submicromolar GI values across multiple malignancies, outperforming previously reported cyclohexa[b]thiophenes in the multidose screening. Mechanistic studies, including microscale thermophoresis (MST) and NanoBRET target engagement assays, confirmed direct binding to both kinases. Computational studies, including molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, revealed key interactions stabilizing MA4 within the ATP-binding sites of both kinases. We demonstrated the potent anticancer activity of MA4 in 3D tumor spheroids, along with its favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Additionally, MA4 exhibited no inhibitory activity against hERG and demonstrated selectivity toward cancer cells over normal cell lines, further supporting its potential for in vivo applications. These findings establish cyclohexa[b]thiophenes as promising dual kinase inhibitors with high selectivity, offering a compelling strategy for targeting mitotic dysregulation in cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary adult CNS tumor. Increased understanding of glioma biology is needed for novel treatment strategies and maximization of current therapies. The action of the widely used antiglioma drug, temozolomide (TMZ), relies on its ability to methylate DNA guanine bases leading to DNA double strand breaks and apoptosis. However, glioma cells capable of reversing guanine methylation via the repair enzyme  -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) are resistant to TMZ. GBMs exhibiting high MGMT expression, reflected by MGMT gene promoter hypomethylation, respond poorly to both chemo- and radiation therapy. To investigate possible non-canonical biological effects of MGMT and develop a tool to investigate drug sensitivity and resistance, we generated MGMT knockout (KO) U1242 GBM cells. MGMT KO U1242 cells showed substantially increased sensitivity to TMZ , and unlike wildtype U1242 cells, failed to form tumors in nude mouse brains. They also showed reduced growth in soft agar, as did wildtype U1242 and additional glioma cell lines in which MGMT expression was knocked down by siRNA. MGMT thus possesses cellular functions related to tumor cell engraftment and anchorage-independent growth beyond guanine methyltransferase repair. We additionally show that the combination of the AURKA inhibitor alisertib and carboplatin selectively induces apoptosis in high MGMT expressing wildtype U1242 cells versus MGMT KO U1242 cells and extends survival of mice orthotopically implanted with wildtype U1242 cells. This or other platinum-based drug combinations may represent a potentially effective treatment approach to chemotherapy for GBM with MGMT promoter hypomethylation.",

This study revealed that the stemness index, strongly linked to poor HCC prognosis, exhibited a robust positive correlation with purine metabolism through single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. Integrated drug screening across CTRP, GDSC, and PRISM databases identified alisertib, an aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor, as a potent agent targeting stemness. Using fibrin gel-based 3D-cultured HCC-TRCs, mechanistic studies demonstrated that alisertib suppresses xanthine and hypoxanthine production by inhibiting the AURKA-AKT signaling axis. This disruption markedly impaired tumor spheroid formation, migration, and invasion in vitro, while significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo, which could be rescued by the AKT agonist SC79. Our findings revealed a novel therapeutic strategy targeting purine metabolism through AURKA-AKT axis inhibition, effectively eliminating HCC-TRCs.",

The proliferation, colony-forming ability, migration and invasion of the treated Hela cells was evaluated using EdU immunofluorescence assay, crystal violet staining, scratch assay, Transwell assay, and Matrigel assay. Western blotting was performed to detect the changes in cellular expressions of EMT-related proteins and expression levels of NF-\u03baBp65 and ARPC4. RESULTS: The expression of ARPC4 was significantly decreased in HeLa cells with Aurora-A knockdown and increased in Aurora-A-overexpressing cells. Aurora-A overexpression obviously promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of HeLa cells, and these effects was significantly antagonized by ARPC4 knockdown. In Aurora-A-overexpressing cells, the phosphorylation level of NF-\u03baBp65 and the expression level of ARPC4 were increased significantly, and application of the NF\u2011\u03baBp65 inhibitor obviously lowered the expression level of ARPC4. CONCLUSIONS: Aurora-A overexpression upregulates the expression of ARPC4 by activating the NF-\u03baBp65 signaling pathway, thereby promoting migration, invasion and EMT of HeLa cells.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The development of radiation resistance by tumor cells severely affects the survival of colorectal cancer patients. The aim of this work is to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance to radiotherapy treatment in colorectal cancer and the identification of key genes as possible biomarkers. METHODS: Data mining was performed in PubMed with the keywords 'colorectal neoplasms', 'radiotherapy', and 'resistance', generating a total of 242 articles in which a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select the articles of interest. Then, an in-silico analysis of the selected genes was performed with the bioinformatic tools: GeneCodis, Metascape, KEGG, REACTOME, STRING, STITCH, CHEA3, DGIdb, CTD, and GEPIA. RESULTS: Different mechanisms and genes involved in radiation resistance were described. These are related to evasion of apoptosis, cell cycle dysregulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and repair of DNA breaks, with the last one being the most relevant and influential. The In-silico study carried out with 21 genes involved in radiation resistance showed the implication of FoxO signaling and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance as the most enriched pathways. In addition, the study identified the key proteins AURKA, BIRC5, and PLK1, showing multiple interacting chemicals and drugs; such as tamoxifen, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, and hydroxyzine pamoate, among others. CONCLUSION: The identification of multiple transcription factors that regulate the expression of these key genes as well as the validation in patient samples where higher expression is observed in tumor patients, conserved across tumor stages I-IV, suggests their potential as possible biomarkers.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer receptor status plays a critical role in treatment selection, yet receptor evolution throughout disease progression remains a significant challenge. This case describes a 58-year-old female initially diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (95%), progesterone receptor (PR)-negative (<5%), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 0, fluorescence in situ hybridization-negative) invasive ductal carcinoma. Over 6\u2009years, her tumor transitioned to triple-negative breast cancer at recurrence, then reacquired ER expression (80%) in metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes. HER2 status evolved from IHC 0\u2009\u2192\u2009HER2-low (IHC 1+\u2009\u2192\u2009IHC 2+), directly influencing therapy selection. These receptor changes led to major systemic treatment modifications, including endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates. Given the extended response duration and improved tolerability of targeted therapies, accurate receptor assessment is essential to ensure that patients receive the most effective treatment. Literature reports receptor discordance rates of ER loss (19%), PR loss (34%), and HER2 fluctuations (15%), reinforcing the necessity of biopsy-driven treatment adaptation. While serial biopsies remain invasive, they provide essential molecular insights that optimize systemic therapy choices, allowing patients to remain on the most appropriate, well-tolerated regimen for as long as possible. This case highlights the clinical significance of receptor evolution and advocates for biopsy-guided precision oncology in metastatic breast cancer management. Ensuring accurate receptor reassessment through periodic molecular profiling can maximize therapeutic efficacy, improving response rates, treatment tolerability, and overall patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While targeted protein degradation is a powerful strategy for eliminating disease-causing proteins, the rational design of monovalent or molecular glue degraders remains challenging. In this study, we generated a library of BET-domain inhibitor JQ1 analogs bearing elaborated electrophilic handles to identify permissive covalent degradative handles and E3 ligase pairs. We identified an elaborated fumaramide handle that, when appended onto JQ1, led to the proteasome-dependent degradation of BRD4. We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4\ue5f8a common E3 ligase target of electrophilic degraders\ue5f8was responsible for BRD4 loss by covalently targeting C173 on DCAF16. While this original fumaramide handle was not permissive to the degradation of other neo-substrates, a truncated version of this handle attached to JQ1 was still capable of degrading BRD4, now through targeting both C173 and C178. This truncated fumaramide handle, when appended to various protein targeting ligands, was also more permissive in degrading other neo-substrates, including CDK4/6, SMARCA2/4, the androgen receptor (AR), as well as the undruggable AR truncation variant AR-V7. We have identified a unique DCAF16-targeting covalent degradative handle that can be transplanted across several protein-targeting ligands to induce the degradation of their respective targets for the modular design of monovalent or bifunctional degraders.",

          "abstract": "Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are a deadly subtype of soft tissue sarcoma for which effective therapeutic options are lacking. Currently, the best treatment for MPNSTs is complete surgical resection with wide negative margins, but this is often complicated by the tumor size and location and/or the presence of metastases. Radiation or chemotherapy may be combined with surgery, but patient responses are poor. Targeted treatments, including small-molecule inhibitors of oncogenic proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), and Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), are promising therapeutics for MPNSTs, especially when combined together, but they have yet to gain approval. Immunotherapeutic approaches have been revolutionary for the treatment of some other cancers, but their utility as single agents in sarcoma is limited and not approved for MPNSTs. The immunosuppressive niche of MPNSTs is thought to confer inherent treatment resistance, particularly to immunotherapies. Remodeling an inherently \"cold\" tumor microenvironment into a \"hot\" immune milieu to bolster the anti-tumor activity of immunotherapies is of great interest throughout the cancer community. This review focuses on novel therapeutics that target dysregulated factors and pathways in MPNSTs, as well as different types of immunotherapies currently under investigation for this disease. We also consider how certain therapeutics may be combined to remodel the MPNST immune microenvironment and thereby generate a durable anti-tumor immune response to immunotherapy.",

While synthetic CDK4/6 inhibitors such as Palbociclib and Ribociclib are clinically effective, their use is limited by significant adverse effects.  In this study, the aqueous root extract of , a traditionally used medicinal plant, was evaluated for its potential as a natural CDK4/6 inhibitor. Phytochemical profiling using GC-MS identified bioactive compounds, which were subsequently subjected to molecular docking, ADME prediction, and in vitro cell-based assays using HCT116 and L929 cells.  The docking results revealed that Isocorydine (-7.4 kcal/mol for CDK4 and -7.2 kcal/mol for CDK6) and Thunbergol (-6.5 kcal/mol for CDK4 and -7.0 kcal/mol for CDK6) exhibited promising binding affinities comparable to standard CDK inhibitors, Palbociclib (-7.2, -8.3 kcal/mol) and Ribociclib (-7.1, -8.1 kcal/mol). Among the other tested natural compounds, Squalene (-7.1 kcal/mol for CDK4) and 2-palmitoylglycerol (-5.2 kcal/mol for CDK4, -4.9 kcal/mol for CDK6) demonstrated moderate binding affinities. ADME analysis confirmed favorable drug-like properties with minimal toxicity alerts. The extract displayed dose-dependent cytotoxicity with an IC of 140 \u03bcg/mL and reduced cell migration in HCT116 cells, indicating potential anti-proliferative effects. These findings suggest that  root extract, through synergistic phytochemical interactions, holds promise as a multi-targeted, plant-based therapeutic candidate for CDK4/6-associated cancers, warranting further in vitro and in vivo validation.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Baseline recurrence risk increasingly guides adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer (BC). The monarchE trial demonstrated the benefits of adding abemaciclib to endocrine therapy for high-risk patients. However, differences in baseline recurrence risks within monarchE Cohort 1 subgroups and their impact on absolute benefit remain unclear. This study assessed these prognostic differences. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 989 patients with HR-positive, and HER2-negative BC who underwent surgery between January 2017 and August 2019 at our institution. Patients were categorised into four groups: non-eligible (not meeting monarchE criteria), N1\u2009+\u2009>5\u00a0cm (1-3 lymph node metastases with tumours >5\u00a0cm), N1\u2009+\u2009G3 (1-3 lymph node metastases with Grade 3 tumours), and \u2265N2 (\u22654 lymph node metastases). Survival outcomes, including invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), distant disease-free survival, and overall survival, were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The 5-year iDFS rates were 94.7% (non-eligible), 88.9% (N1\u2009+\u2009>5\u00a0cm), 83.3% (N1\u2009+\u2009G3), and 77.3% (\u2265N2) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified N1\u2009+\u2009G3 HR3.38, p\u2009=\u20090.005), \u2265N2 (HR 3.39, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.71, p\u2009=\u20090.003) as poor prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prognostic variability among high-risk subgroups aligned with monarchE Cohort 1 criteria. Individualized risk assessment will be key to optimizing the benefit of adjuvant therapy in HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both neoadjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy only result in trivial pathological complete response rates and moderate objective response rates (ORR) in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, more promising alternatives are urgently needed. With proven synergistic effect of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor and radiotherapy in preclinical studies, this pilot study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by dalpiciclib and exemestane in HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. METHODS: This was a single-arm, non-controlled prospective pilot study. Treatment-naive patients with unilateral HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer received neoadjuvant radiotherapy (24 Gy/3 F) followed by dalpiciclib and exemestane for six cycles. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with residual cancer burden (RCB) score of 0-I. Key secondary endpoints included ORR, breast-conservation rate, biomarker analysis, and safety. RESULTS: All 12 enrolled patients completed the study treatment and surgery. Two (16.7%) of them achieved the RCB 0-I with the ORR of 91.7% (11/12). Analyses of tumor specimens showed significant increase of infiltrating T cells rather than alteration of PD-L1 positive immune cells. The most common grade 3 adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia (66.7%) and leukopenia (25.0%), but no grade 4-5 AE or death occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested neoadjuvant SBRT followed by dalpiciclib and exemestane is effective and tolerable and provides novel insights for the neoadjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer, which may be considered as a feasible option for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The confirmed efficacy of combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy (ET) in HR+, HER2- early breast cancer patients in longer follow-up necessitates further investigation. This meta-analysis aims to comprehensively assess the impact of follow-up duration on the therapeutic activity in high-risk patients. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and relevant conference abstracts up to 19 October 2024. The included RCTs examined CDK4/6 inhibitors with ET in HR + HER2- early breast cancer patients. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to analyze invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). RESULTS: Four RCTs with 3-year and 4-year iDFS data (n = 17,749) were included. The results showed that the CDK4/6 inhibitor group had significantly better iDFS compared to the ET group at both 3 years (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94, P = 0.006) and 4 years (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.94, P = 0.007). Subgroup analysis revealed that in LN + patients, the CDK4/6 inhibitor group also had significantly better iDFS at both 3\u00a0years (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97, P = 0.02) and 4\u00a0years (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.81, P < 0.00001). For N0 patients, iDFS benefits became more evident over time. At 4\u00a0years, combination therapy showed significant improvement (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.94, P = 0.02). For stage II patients, CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with ET showed no statistically significant difference in iDFS at treatment completion (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.59-1.05, P = 0.10), but significantly improved iDFS at 4\u00a0years (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.87, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The iDFS improvement with CDK4/6 inhibitors becomes more evident over time, suggesting broader benefits and enhanced long-term efficacy for HR+, HER2-breast cancer patients especially with N0 or Stage II.

          "abstract": "Resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) is a major challenge in treating hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. This study aimed to identify a biomarker predictive of resistance that could also serve as a therapeutic target. Circulating IL-6 levels in 166 patients significantly increased at progression, making IL-6 a non-invasive biomarker to predict CDK4/6i resistance. Knockdown of IL-6 re-sensitized resistant cells to palbociclib and endocrine therapy, underscoring IL-6's critical role in maintaining resistance. Patient-derived xenograft models from patients who progressed within 3 months versus \u22656 months of palbociclib therapy revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles, with later progressors exhibiting IL-6/STAT3 activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and immune evasion signatures. Treatment with TTI-101, a STAT3 inhibitor, significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival in these models, providing preclinical validation for targeting the IL-6/STAT3 axis. These findings support using IL-6 to guide personalized treatment and combining STAT3 inhibitors with CDK4/6i as a transformative strategy to overcome resistance.",

          "abstract": "One of the most common malignancies diagnosed globally is breast cancer, a condition that is impacted by both environmental and genetic causes, there are three distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer: hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-positive (HER2+), and triple-negative (TNBC). About 70-75 % of instances of breast cancer are HR+, whereas 15-25 % of cases are HER2+ tumours, which can be successfully treated with targeted therapy. TNBC poses specific treatment problems and is linked to an increased risk of early recurrence because it lacks expression of ER, PR, and HER2. With the discovery of Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), such as ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib, the treatment of advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer has shifted. These drugs are essential for arresting the cell cycle and limiting tumour growth. These inhibitors particularly target the cell cycle development from the G1 to the S phase, which is frequently dysregulated in breast cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors' full potential is still being investigated, including the way they might be applied to various breast cancer subtypes and in conjunction with other treatments. This review comprehensively examines the utilization strategies of CDK 4/6 inhibitors across various breast cancer subtypes, explores the mechanism of resistance, and highlights potential applications in combination with other treatments. Through a detailed analysis of clinical trials and real-world data, The review highlights how CDK4/6 inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment landscape for breast cancer, paving the way for optimized treatment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genomic determinants of response and resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) beyond progression in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer are not well characterized. We analyzed serial circulating tumor DNA from the PACE trial in which patients who progressed on ET and CDK4/6i were randomized to fulvestrant, fulvestrant plus palbociclib, or fulvestrant, palbociclib, and avelumab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples from 200 of 220 PACE participants were collected for circulating tumor DNA analysis using the Guardant360 assay. Samples included baseline (n = 200), cycle 3, day 1 (C3D1; n = 124), and end of treatment (n = 137). The fulvestrant and fulvestrant + palbociclib arms were combined given similar clinical outcomes. The log-rank test was used to test associations between genomic alterations and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The most common baseline genomic alterations beyond progression on CDK4/6i plus ET, were mutations in ESR1 (54.0%), TP53 (35.5%), PIK3CA (34.0%), GATA3 (18.5%), and RB1 (10.0%). Among 150 patients treated with fulvestrant or fulvestrant + palbociclib, baseline mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, RB1, and the Y537S ESR1 mutation, were associated with shorter PFS. Mutations within the PI3K and cell cycle pathways were associated with significantly decreased PFS. We also observed increases in the allelic fractions of the ESR1, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations at progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several mutations within genes and biological pathways are associated with CDK4/6i resistance beyond progression. Additional studies are needed to optimize treatment after resistance to CDK4/6i using genomic biomarkers.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nonclinical evidence demonstrating that estrogen receptor (ER), CDK4/6, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathways cross-promote tumor proliferation in HR+/HER2- breast cancer cell lines led to development of CDK4/6 inhibitors and agents inhibiting single PAM pathway nodes to treat HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC). Simultaneous blockade of ER, CDK4/6 and PAM pathways may optimize anti-tumor control in the treatment-na\u00efve ABC setting. Gedatolisib, a pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, was evaluated as first-line therapy, combined with standard-of-care palbociclib and letrozole, for patients with HR+/HER2- ABC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment-na\u00efve patients from a phase 1b study with HR+/HER2- ABC treated with gedatolisib plus palbociclib and letrozole were analyzed. The primary endpoint of the overall study was investigator-assessed objective response. Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 41 patients, all had stage IV disease, 93% measurable disease, 78% visceral metastases, and 22% detectable PIK3CA mutations. The overall response rate (ORR) was 79% in patients with evaluable disease (N=33). Median DOR was 48 months for confirmed responders. Median PFS was 48.4 months and median OS was 77.3 months. ORR and PFS were comparable in patients with and without PIK3CA mutations. Fewer than 10% discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events. The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (61%), rash (39%), and oral stomatitis (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Gedatolisib plus palbociclib and letrozole demonstrated preliminary efficacy in patients with no prior systemic therapy for ABC. These results warrant further evaluation of gedatolisib added to standard-of-care, first-line therapy for HR+/HER2- ABC.",

          "title": "Optimizing Adjuvant Care in Early Breast Cancer: Multidisciplinary Strategies and Innovative Models from Canadian Centers.",
          "abstract": "The adjuvant treatment landscape for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (EBC) is rapidly evolving, with a diverse range of therapeutic options-including endocrine therapies, bisphosphonates, ovarian function suppression, olaparib, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and emerging agents such as immunotherapy. While these advances have markedly improved patient outcomes, they also introduce challenges related to implementation, monitoring, and resource allocation. Notably, therapies like CDK4/6 inhibitors require particularly close monitoring, creating logistical and capacity challenges for medical oncologists, whose workloads are already stretched due to rising cancer incidence and treatment complexities. These challenges underscore the need for innovative care delivery solutions to ensure patients with EBC continue to receive optimal care. This paper offers a comprehensive guide-a playbook-of multidisciplinary-team-based care models designed to optimize adjuvant treatment delivery in EBC. Drawing on real-world evidence and successful applications across Canadian centers, we explore models led by nurses, nurse practitioners (NPs), general practitioners in oncology (GPO), and pharmacists. Each model leverages the unique expertise of its team to manage treatment toxicities, facilitate adherence, and enhance patient education, thereby promoting effective and sustainable care delivery. Importantly, these models are not intended to compete with one another, but rather to serve as a flexible recipe book from which breast cancer care teams can draw strategies tailored to their local resources and patient needs. By detailing implementation strategies, benefits, and challenges-in many instances supported by quantitative metrics and economic evaluations-this work aims to inspire care teams nationwide to optimize the adjuvant management of patients with HR+, HER2- EBC.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Several cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Despite the side effects that affect patients' quality of life, most patients still opt for CDK4/6 inhibitors due to their significant benefits. However, to further enhance treatment efficacy and safety, new approaches are still needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, Phase 1 trial enrolled Chinese patients with HR+, HER2-advanced breast cancers. The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: During the dose-escalation phase, a DLT was observed in the 150\u00a0mg bid dose cohort, specifically, 2 patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia. MTD of BEBT-209 was 100\u00a0mg bid, and the most common adverse event (AE) was neutropenia. In Phase 1b, the median PFS of patients with BEBT-209 alone, BEBT-209 plus letrozole, and BEBT-209 plus fulvestrant was 10.38 months, 24.94 months, and not reached, respectively. At doses of 25\u00a0mg qd-150 mg bid, steady state areas under the concentration-time curve and peak concentration increased proportionally with dose. The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were neutropenia (65.4\u00a0%), lymphocytopenia (7.4\u00a0%), and anaemia (4.9\u00a0%). CONCLUSION: BEBT-209 was a primary CDK4 selective inhibitor and showed an acceptable safety profile and dose-dependent plasma exposure. The results highlight the potential of combination treatments as compelling options, particularly in combination with fulvestrant.",

          "abstract": "Targeting the cell cycle has become a focus of cancer research bearing impressive results with the introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, no definitive benefit in other cancers has been observed. In gastrointestinal cancers, despite preclinical studies pinpointing positive effects on cancer inhibition in pre-clinical models, no positive clinical trials have been published with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Several biomarkers have been proposed in breast cancers, where the field is more advanced, and include up-regulations of the inhibited kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and their partner cyclin D as well as the main target of phosphorylation, RB. Up-regulation of Cyclin E, an E2F1/RB regulated gene, also arises as a marker of CDK4/6 inhibition resistance. Signaling from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways through KRAS/BRAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are also implicated in feedback CDK4/6 activation and inhibitors resistance. In gastrointestinal cancers, some of these biomarkers have also proven valuable in predicting sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors and would lead markers to guide clinical development. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment, where immune cells are prominent components, arises as a feature of CDK4/6 inhibition and could be harnessed in therapeutic combinations.",

          "abstract": "Several mechanisms of resistance of cancer cells to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) have been identified, including the upregulation of metabolic regulators such as glutaminase. However, whether such resistance mechanisms represent optimal targets has not been determined. Here, we have systematically analyzed metabolic reprogramming in colorectal cancer cells exposed to Palbociclib, a CDKi selectively targeting CDK4/6, or Telaglenastat, a selective glutaminase inhibitor. Through multiple approaches, we show that Palbociclib and Telaglenastat elicit complementary metabolic responses and are thus uniquely suited to counter the metabolic reprogramming induced by the reciprocal drug. As such, while Palbociclib induced reduced tumor growth in vivo, and Telaglenastat did not show a significant effect, the drug combination displayed a strong synergistic effect on tumor growth. Likewise, initial responses to Palbociclib were followed by signs of adaptation and resistance, which were prevented by combining Palbociclib with Telaglenastat. In conclusion, combination with Telaglenastat optimally forestalls acquired resistance to Palbociclib in cancer cells.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is a key driver of cancer progression, making them attractive therapeutic targets. In CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i)-resistant breast cancer, targeting CDK2 offers a promising approach. CDK2 is frequently hyperactivated due to cyclin E1 overexpression or retinoblastoma protein loss, acting as a mechanism that sustains proliferation despite CDK4/6 inhibition. CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i) show strong anti-tumor activity, particularly in combination with CDK4/6i or immune checkpoint inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: This review explores the biological roles of CDK2 and its regulatory mechanisms. The review highlights the latest advancements in CDK2i, their mechanisms of action, and their potential in combination strategies with CDK4/6i, chemotherapy, and immunotherapies. Additionally, it examines other emerging targets, such as CDK7 and CDK5, which contribute to transcriptional regulation and immune evasion, respectively. EXPERT OPINION: Future research should focus on biomarker-driven patient selection, optimizing CDK2i combinations, and expanding CDK7 inhibitor applications. Integrating multi-omics profiling can refine patient stratification, while combination strategies with chemotherapy, DNA damaging agents, and immunotherapies may enhance efficacy. CDK7 inhibitors could also complement CDK2 targeting by modulating resistance mechanisms. Personalized, adaptive treatment approaches will be key to maximizing the clinical impact of CDK2 and CDK7 inhibitors in breast cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide, with relatively high morbidity and mortality rates among Chinese women, posing a serious threat to female health. HR+/HER-2- breast cancer is the most common subtype, accounting for approximately 70% of all breast cancers. The vast majority of patients are diagnosed with early breast cancer (EBC) at initial presentation. Stage \u2161-\u2162 EBC constitutes a substantial proportion of cases among Chinese patients, with a significantly younger age of onset observed nationally. Even after standard endocrine therapy, patients still face short-term and long-term recurrence risks, and the risk of recurrence persists lifelong. In recent years, large-scale real-world studies from the National Cancer Center and other institutions, both domestically and internationally, have shown that for stage \u2161-\u2162 HR+/HER-2- EBC patients, those with lymph node positivity and lymph node negative patients with high-risk factors have a significantly higher risk of recurrence and death. The postoperative 5-year recurrence rate for lymph node negative patients with high-risk factors can reach 15%, similar to the recurrence rate of N1 patients. These findings have updated the clinical understanding of defining high-risk patients and raised new requirements for EBC recurrence risk assessment and definition. On the other hand, the clinical management of recurrence risk in early HR+/HER-2- breast cancer has consistently received significant attention. From the initial adjuvant chemotherapy to the entire process of adjuvant endocrine therapy, in recent years, with the publication of clinical trial results for novel targeted agents such as CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and the subsequent approval of their indications, the treatment paradigm for HR+/HER-2- EBC has gradually evolved from traditional endocrine therapy to a selective strategy of intensified treatment combining endocrine therapy with targeted agents. This underscores the critical importance of precise recurrence risk assessment and optimization of treatment decisions. To assist clinicians in scientifically and accurately assessing recurrence risk and tailoring individualized intensified adjuvant treatment regimens for patients, the Breast Cancer Expert Committee of the National Cancer Quality Control Center, the Professional Committee of Drug Clinical Research of Chinese Anti-Cancer Association, and the Professional Committee of Breast Cancer of the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association, incorporating advances in clinical research on early breast cancer both domestically and internationally and expert opinions, have formulated the \"Consensus on Recurrence Risk and Clinical Management of HR+/HER-2- Early Breast Cancer(2025 edition)\". It aims to provide a standardized reference for recurrence risk stratification and clinical management of HR+/HER-2-EBC patients, further enhancing patient treatment benefits and quality of life, and maximizing the potential for cure.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric illness, significantly contributing to disability and suicide rates. While dysfunctions in neurotransmission, notably monoaminergic transmission, are commonly attributed to MDD, involvement of the glutamatergic system in comorbid depressive disorders suggests its potential as a target for antidepressant therapy. Despite evidence of diminished glutamatergic neuron activity in the midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in rodent models of depression-which projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region regulating depression-like behaviors-the precise neurocircuit mechanisms within the vlPAG remain unclear. METHODS: To investigate dysregulation of glutamatergic transmission in the vlPAG and its role in depression-like behavior, we combined behavioral testing, pharmacological manipulation, retrograde tracing, and electrophysiological recording in male C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Mice receiving intravlPAG infusion of the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 exhibited reversal of depression-like behaviors. Chronic restraint stress (CRS) elicited depression-like behavior, whereas intravlPAG administration of LY341495 reversed these behaviors. VTA-projecting vlPAG neurons exhibited reduced frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and decreased neuronal excitability. Blocking mGlu2/3 receptors, which act as autoreceptors inhibiting glutamate release, in the vlPAG rescued these effects. Moreover, intravlPAG microinjection of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blocker verapamil, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor antagonist ANA-12, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor rapamycin, and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione prevented LY341495-induced reversal of depression-like behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This provides the first direct evidence that blockade of mGlu2/3 receptors in the vlPAG ameliorates depression-like behavior, highlighting their role in regulating vlPAG-VTA neurocircuits implicated in MDD pathophysiology.",

          "title": "The Role of Kinase Inhibitors in Cancer Neuroscience: Mechanisms, Therapeutic Potential, and Future Directions.",
          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cancer progression is increasingly understood to be influenced by neural mechanisms, including neurotransmitter signaling, neurotrophic factor activity, neuroinflammation, and neurogenic inflammation. These neurobiological interactions contribute to tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Kinase inhibitors, a class of targeted therapies that block dysregulated kinase activity, have demonstrated promise not only in direct tumor suppression but also in modulating neural pathways associated with cancer progression. METHODS: This review examines the role of kinase inhibitors in modulating cancer-associated neural mechanisms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies exploring the effects of kinase inhibition on: (1) neurotransmitter signaling pathways; (2) neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); (3) neuroinflammation through glial cell modulation; and (4) neurogenic inflammation. Additionally, we assessed the impact of kinase inhibitors on tumor-induced axonogenesis and stress-related signaling. Clinical relevance was evaluated through analysis of preclinical models, human case studies, and outcomes from relevant clinical trials. RESULTS: Kinase inhibitors were found to significantly modulate neural factors that facilitate tumor growth. Specifically, they can suppress neurotrophic signaling (e.g., NGF/TrkA, BDNF/TrkB), inhibit glial activation, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and block neurotransmitter-induced proliferation. Inhibition of stress-responsive kinases such as p38 MAPK and JNK also disrupted tumor-associated axonogenesis and inflammation. Clinical trials demonstrate improved outcomes in cancers such as glioblastoma, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer when kinase inhibitors are employed with consideration of neural mechanisms. DISCUSSION: These findings support the emerging concept of targeting the neural tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy. Kinase inhibitors represent a dual-action approach, suppressing both cancer cell intrinsic growth pathways and the neural factors that sustain them. However, several challenges persist, including resistance mechanisms, variability in patient neural profiles, and off-target effects. Future research should focus on the development of neural-specific kinase inhibitors, the use of neural biomarkers for therapy selection, and the integration of neuro-oncology into personalized treatment plans. CONCLUSION: Kinase inhibitors offer a promising frontier in cancer treatment by targeting neural mechanisms that contribute to tumor progression. While current evidence is encouraging, further investigation is required to optimize their use within neuro-oncology. Personalized approaches and novel targets within the neural-cancer axis will be essential for translating this strategy into clinical practice and improving long-term patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease. Sensitization of central pain pathways by pro-inflammatory mediators has been implicated in RA pain. Locus coeruleus (LC) functions in pain pathways. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the modulation of nociception and pain. A mouse model of RA immunized with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was used for investigating the mechanisms of pain relief by administration of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor antagonist ANA-12. We measured the pain behaviors and locomotor activity and found increased pain sensitivity and locomotor deficit in RA mice; ANA-12 treatment reduced pain behaviors and promoted locomotor function recovery. The glial activation and increased activities of BDNF/TrkB and MAPK signal pathways were found in LC of RA mice. The components of NLRP3 inflammasome were all increased and consequently enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. Upon ANA-12 treatment, glial cell activation was reduced, BDNF/TrkB and MAPK pathways were suppressed, and the expression levels of the above-mentioned proteins were reduced. Finally, U251 cells were conducted to further confirm the regulatory mechanisms of ANA-12 on inflammation. The results showed the colocalization of BDNF/NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 and GFAP. ANA-12 treatment decreased the protein levels of BDNF, TrkB, MAPK, NLRP3, and caspase-1 in IL-1\u03b2-induced cells. Besides, ANA-12 treatment decreased NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes both in RA mice and IL-1\u03b2-induced cells. These results suggested that ANA-12 alleviates hyperalgesia in RA mice by inhibiting BDNF/TrkB signaling in LC, thereby reducing glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokine release.",

          "abstract": "Current study aims to investigate the ameliorative effects of exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supplementation, in combination with microRNA-93 (miR-93) inhibitors, on acute glaucoma mouse models, and to delve into the underlying mechanisms. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) apoptosis was assessed using the MTT assay and flow cytometry. Acute glaucoma was induced by elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) in mice, which were divided into groups receiving PBS, miR-93 inhibitors, BDNF, or combination therapy, alongside a healthy control group. Retinal tissues were analyzed for thickness, ganglion cell layer (GCL) cell counts, and pathological changes. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting assessed mRNA and protein expression related to the Rho/ROCK and BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathways. Rescue experiments employing specific inhibitors and agonists targeting these pathways were conducted to further elucidate the mechanisms involved. The combination therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the survival of RGCs by inhibiting apoptosis induced by OGD/R. Additionally, this combined treatment ameliorated the elevation of IOP, retinal damage, and reduction in retinal thickness observed in glaucoma models. Notably, the combination therapy resulted in increased ganglion cell layer (GCL) cell counts compared to monotherapy groups, indicating a synergistic effect on retinal preservation (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Western blot revealed that combination therapy inhibited the Rho/ROCK pathway and ECM-related protein expression, while enhancing BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling and MMP-related protein expression (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Rescue experiments showed that BDNF inhibitors and Rho agonists reversed these effects. In conclusion, the combination of BDNF supplementation and miR-93 inhibitors exerts synergistic effects in acute glaucoma by inhibiting the Rho/ROCK pathway and activating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common disorder in clinical practice, characterized by various manifestations, with fear extinction dysfunction being a typical one. Postoperative persistent pain, a form of chronic pain following surgical procedures, significantly affects patients' quality of life. Clinical studies have demonstrated the comorbidity between chronic pain and PTSD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain unclear. Researches have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are crucial in fear extinction dysfunction. Thus, we established a skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) mice model to explore the roles of hippocampal NMDARs and BDNF signaling pathways in fear extinction following postoperative persistent pain. We found that SMIR mice exhibited contextual fear extinction dysfunction, potentially caused by a down-regulated NMDARs/ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway and impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Hippocampal injection of the NMDARs agonist NMDA promoted extinction learning and retrieval of extinction memory, activating the NMDARs/ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, and restoring lost dendritic spines. Simultaneous hippocampal administration of NMDA and the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12 promoted the learning process of fear extinction without enhancing the retrieval of extinction memory, while re-inducing dendritic spine loss. In summary, we conclude that postoperative persistent pain impairs synaptic plasticity by downregulating the NMDARs/ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, thereby inducing contextual fear extinction dysfunction. These findings may partially explain the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity between chronic pain and PTSD.",

          "abstract": "T-type/Cav3 calcium channels are key in neuronal excitability and pain processing with Cav3.2 being the prominent isoform in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Cav3.2 pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing induces analgesia in several preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, the presence of Cav3.2, encoded by the CACNA1H gene, in human DRG neurons remains unresolved. Using RNA in-situ hybridization and electrophysiological recordings, we show that human DRGs express Cav3.2 in a subset of neurons positive for the neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB (NTRK2 gene). The Cav3.2 current exhibits typical biophysical and pharmacological properties, including inhibition by a low concentration of nickel and by Z944, a specific T-type calcium channel blocker in advanced clinical development. Conversely, ABT-639, a T-type calcium channel inhibitor that failed in Phase 2 trials for pain relief, does not inhibit Cav3.2 currents in human DRG neurons. Importantly, Cav3.2 currents are prominent in neurons from female organ donors, supporting the presence of sex differences in pain mechanisms in humans. These findings underscore the potential of continued exploration of Cav3.2 as a therapeutic target for pain treatment and highlight a specific subset of human neurons that likely rely on this channel to modulate their excitability.",

          "abstract": "Depression is a common yet potentially debilitating mood disorder with complex neurobiological underpinnings, including deficiencies in monoaminergic and glutamatergic signaling, overactivity of the lateral habenula, and dysregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. Ketamine has emerged as a mechanistically novel, effective, and rapidly acting antidepressant. Ketamine's primary effects are due to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism, although hypotheses regarding the importance of its impact on monoaminergic signaling (preclinical evidence), BDNF signaling (preclinical evidence), opioid receptor agonism (preclinical evidence), and neuroinflammation (clinical evidence) have gained traction. Compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), ketamine demonstrates greater efficacy, a significantly faster onset of action, and generally more tolerable side effects. However, its benefits are offset by a far shorter duration of antidepressant effects and accessibility limitations.\u00a0In a head-to-head trial, compared to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), ketamine showed similar efficacy in non-psychotic depression while providing clinically significant relief more rapidly. While promising, further research is needed to optimize ketamine's dosing regimen, enhance its accessibility, and better understand potential drawbacks such as bladder toxicity and addiction potential. Additionally, studying the mechanisms behind ketamine's antidepressant action may provide deeper insight into the neurobiology of depression.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disorder posing various public health challenges; however, the treatment is lacking. Kirenol (Kir), a natural diterpenoid compound with various bioactive properties, demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects on PC12 cells subjected to glutamic acid injury. However, the protective mechanism of Kir remains undefined. OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether Kir could alleviate cerebral ischemic injury by protecting neurons and promoting synaptic plasticity. The molecular mechanisms involved were also elucidated. METHODS: Kir was injected intraperitoneally into rats subjected to cerebral ischemic insult induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO/R). Neurobiological changes, brain infarct size, apoptosis, neuroplasticity, and levels of target proteins were assessed. The mechanism of Kir in protecting neurons and promoting synaptic plasticity via histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was demonstrated using inhibitor of Tumorigenesis and Senescence Associated 1 (ITSA-1, an HDAC activator), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, an HDAC inhibitor), and HDAC2 overexpression recombinant adenovirus. RESULTS: Kir mitigated MCAO-induced cerebral infarct area, neurological deficits, histopathological damage, and neuronal apoptosis in rats. Kir effectively increased dendritic spine density, total dendritic length, and branching and upregulated the expression of key neuroplasticity proteins (GAP-43, PSD-95, Synapsin-I, and \u03b1-Synuclein). Mechanically, Kir significantly decreased HDAC2 expression and activity, facilitated an increase in H4 acetylation BDNF promoter II, enhancing BDNF expression, and activating the TrKB signaling pathway, thereby exerting neuroprotective effect in MCAO rats. The neuroprotection of Kir on neurons and synaptic plasticity were reversed by ITSA-1 and HDAC2 overexpression recombinant adenovirus. CONCLUSION: Kir exerted its protective effects through acetylation changes in histones and increased expression of BDNF-specific isoforms, thereby safeguarding neurons, promoting synaptic plasticity, and offering potential as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.",

          "abstract": "Brain\u2011derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the neurotrophin family of growth factors that regulate the development of the central nervous system during fetal growth. Apart from its role in neurogenesis, BDNF, along with its high\u2011affinity receptor tropomyosin\u2011related receptor kinase B (TrkB), serves a key role in the pathogenesis of several tumors such as breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, and gliomas. The oncogenic effects of BDNF and TrkB upregulation, including effects on the aggressiveness, metastatic potential and resistance to standard chemotherapeutic agents, are mediated by the downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, EGFR activation and MAPK pathways. In view of the key role served by BDNF and TrkB in various steps of oncogenesis, there have been attempts to develop inhibitors of the TrkB receptor to block the effects of BDNF upregulation, and these have shown promising results. The role of the BDNF\u2011TrkB pathway in the pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer (GBC), a biliary tract malignancy with high mortality, has still not been fully elucidated. Immunohistochemical expression of TrkB at the invasive front of GBC has been demonstrated along with the growth inhibitory effect of TrkB siRNA on GBC cell lines, suggesting the role of this pathway in the aggressiveness of GBC. The present review explores the mechanisms of action of the BDNF\u2011TrkB axis, focusing on GBC, in an attempt to provide future research directions for delineating the role of this pathway in the pathogenesis of GBC and the potential therapeutic implications.",

          "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is known to cause depression-like symptoms in mice, however, the mechanisms are still unclear. The present study aimed to establish a mouse model of depression-like behavior induced by B[a]P and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms. Forty robust male ICR mice were randomly categorized into 4 groups and received intraperitoneal injections (i.p.) of peanut oil or B[a]P at doses of 0.5, 2, or 10\u00a0mg/kg, 30 times over a period of 60 days. Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate depression-like symptoms, identify neuronal structural alterations and cellular apoptosis, and measure the protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) in the cerebral cortex. To further explore the regulatory role of miRNA, small RNA sequencing was performed in HT22 cells treated with B[a]P at concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 20 \u00b5M, which revealed the dysregulated miRNA expression profiles. The interaction between miR-134-5p and BDNF mRNA was examined, along with its inhibitory effects in both in vivo and in vitro contexts. Findings indicated that B[a]P exposure significantly induced depression-like behavior and neuronal damage in mice in a dose-dependent manner, in contrast to the controls, and was associated with a reduction in BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway proteins in the cerebral cortex. As compared to the respective controls, B[a]P exposure notably triggered an irregular miRNA expression profile (encompassing miR-10b-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-134-5p, and miR-155-5p) in both the cerebral cortex of mice and HT22 cells. Owing to its uniform alterations in expression profiles in vivo and in vitro, miR-134-5p was chosen as the target miRNA for follow-up mechanistic research employing a miR-134-5p inhibitor (at concentrations of 100 nM) in HT22 cells. Following a 48-hour in vitro treatment with B[a]P (20 \u00b5M), there was a notable reduction in proteins linked to the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway, in contrast to DMSO controls. This decrease was markedly ameliorated in HT22 cells that had been transfected with the miR-134-5p inhibitor. The research uncovered the pivotal function of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway in B[a]P-induced depressive-like behavior in vivo, and showed a regulatory role of miR-134-5p in this pathway. These findings suggest a potential intervention target against the depression-like behaviors resulting from B[a]P exposure.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, with its pathological hallmark being progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Recent research has illuminated the crucial role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system (CNS), highlighting its impact on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival. Dysregulation of the BDNF signaling axis, particularly the imbalance between its precursor form and mature BDNF, is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. This review explores the molecular mechanisms through which BDNF modulates AD neuropathology and presents novel therapeutic strategies to activate BDNF signaling. We focus on the potential of BDNF activators, such as TrkB agonists and mimetic molecules, to restore synaptic function and ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD. Furthermore, we examine the challenges in translating these findings into clinical practice, including issues with blood-brain barrier penetration and the need for precise receptor targeting. The review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of repurposed drugs, including statins and metformin, in enhancing BDNF signaling and offers new insights into the future of AD treatment. Ultimately, this work provides a compelling argument for BDNF-based therapies as a promising avenue for mitigating the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease, signaling a hopeful direction for future research and clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) activates the TrkB receptor, offering neuroprotection, yet its pharmacological limitations restrict its safe and effective delivery to the eye and brain, impeding clinical translation. This study explores the protective effects of oral 7,8-DHF on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by inhibiting ferroptosis and investigates the involvement of the gut-retina axis, particularly the Indoleacrylic acid (IDA)-AhR-ALDH1A3-FSP1 pathway, with potential clinical implications. METHODS: To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of oral 7,8-DHF, retinal 3D cultures were used for axon regeneration and GCL cell apoptosis, and ONC models for RGC survival and electrophysiology. Mechanisms were investigated by assessing ferroptosis-related proteins via Western blotting, screening differential metabolites in PC12 cells, analyzing mitochondrial changes with TEM, evaluating gut microbiota shifts, and examining metabolite changes in retina and feces. RESULTS: Oral 7,8-DHF enhanced RGC survival and retinal function in the ONC model by inhibiting ferroptosis, independent of TrkB activation. This effect was blocked by antibiotics and AHR, ALDH1A3, and FSP1 inhibitors. Metabolomics showed increased IDA in retina and feces, with IDA inhibiting ferroptosis in PC12 cells and promoting axonal regeneration in retinal explants. Western blot revealed upregulation of nAhR and ALDH1A3, while non-FSP1 ferroptosis proteins were unaffected. 7,8-DHF also altered gut microbiota, increasing Parasutterella, which correlated with higher IDA levels. CONCLUSIONS: 7,8-DHF regulates the gut microbiota to increase IDA levels in the intestine, which subsequently leads to the accumulation of IDA in the retina. This activates the AhR-ALDH1A3-FSP1 axis in the retina, thereby inhibiting retinal ferroptosis and exerting neuroprotective effects.",

          "abstract": "Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug's antidepressant action from a single administration. Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action. Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6). The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months. The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition-mediated synaptic and behavioral effects. These data suggest that ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.",

          "abstract": "Quercetin (Que), one of the flavonoids, plays a role in fracture healing, while brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptor kinase B (TrkB) have also been shown to be involved. Que and BDNF signaling pathways are interrelated in the nervous system, but their reciprocal regulatory mechanisms in fracture healing and osteoblast differentiation have not yet been studied. We conducted cellular experiments and fracture animal models to preliminarily clarify the roles and signaling mechanisms of Que and BDNF in osteoblast differentiation and fracture healing. Cellular experiments confirmed that low concentrations of Que (0.01-5\u00a0\u03bcM) promoted osteoblast differentiation and the expression of osteogenesis-related markers, including COL1A1, ALP and Runx2; activated EKR1/2 and promoted the expression of BDNF (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); and that the combination of Que and exogenous BDNF had the strongest effect on promoting osteogenic differentiation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); further mechanistic studies revealed that, the ERK1/2-specific chemical inhibitor PD98059 significantly inhibited the expression of BDNF and osteogenic differentiation markers under the action of Que (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the TrkB-specific chemical inhibitor K252a inhibited the activation of ERK1/2, the expression of BDNF, and the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers under the effect of Que (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In fracture animal models, Que (100\u00a0mg/kg) significantly promoted fracture healing and increased BDNF expression at the bone callus. Thus, low concentrations of Que promote osteogenic differentiation through the TrkB-ERK1/2-BDNF signaling pathway, which in turn affects fracture healing.",

          "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is one of the top-ranked causes of death and disability in the world, but still lacking efficacy treatment options. Excitotoxicity caused by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) hyperactivation plays a key role in brain injury after ischemic stroke. GluN2B, the regulatory subunit of NMDARs, plays an important role in brain injury induced by ischemic stroke, and specific antagonists of GluN2B can ameliorate brain damage induced by ischemic stroke in rats. However, over half a century after Memantine (the first NMDA partial inhibitor for Alzheimer's clinical treatment) was identified, only a few additional NMDA partial inhibitors, especially those specifically targeting GluN2B, have been discovered. In this study, by using whole patch-clamp technique and multiple molecular biological methods, we discovered a new specific GluN2B partial antagonist, named FLY26, and further determined its effects on alleviating the brain injury caused by ischemic stroke in rats. Our experiment results showed FLY26 suppressed the excitotoxicity caused by overactivation of NMDARs in SH-SY5Y cells, and ameliorated brain damage of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) rats, within the dosage range of 1.5-6.0\u00a0mg/kg, via BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. Our results indicated that FLY26 is a promising lead compound for the development of novel, specific GluN2B partial antagonist. Our results indicated that FLY26 is a promising lead compound for the development of novel, specific GluN2B partial antagonist, which may offer better safety profile as a therapeutic intervention for ischemic stroke.",

          "abstract": "Chronic alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) is mainly manifested as learning and memory impairment and cognitive decline in the long term. Ca plays a key role in learning and memory impairment. The increase of intracellular Ca concentration can directly cause mitochondrial dysfunction, destroy normal physiological signal transduction, and accelerate the process of learning and memory decline. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a selective inhibitor of Cystathionine\u03b2-synthase (CBS), has a good effect on a variety of diseases, including improving stroke and reducing the incidence of convulsions. However, its potential in maintaining learning and memory functions by regulating Ca and mitochondrial functional status remains uncertain. In this study, chronic alcoholism rats and human neuroblastoma cells (SHSY-5Y) were used as the research objects to establish a chronic alcohol-related brain damage model. We aimed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which AOAA protects learning and memory functions in alcohol-induced learning and memory impairment. Through Morris water maze test, LTP test, Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), mitochondrial observation under electron microscope, calcium ion concentration measurement and mitochondrial membrane potential measurement, it was found that AOAA could not only regulate the level of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) caused by HS elevation, but also maintain the role of valve of Sec61 channel on Ca by restoring the level of BIP, a key indicator of ERS, significantly alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Ca overload, and optimize learning and memory function. The mechanism may be closely related to the BDNF-TrkB pathway.",

          "abstract": "CaMKII is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a crucial role in normal and pathological conditions. However, limited information is available regarding the roles of CaMKII in dentinogenesis, particularly in an inflammatory context. Previously, we demonstrated the pivotal role of TrkB in inflammation-induced differentiation of hDPSCs into odontoblast-like cells. Here, we investigate the interaction between CaMKII and TrkB during hDPSCs odontogenic differentiation. hDPSCs were cultured and subjected to CaMKII knockdown using siRNA, followed by treatment with dentinogenic media. TNF\u03b1-stimulated cells were treated with CaMKII- inhibitor, -protein, or TrkB antagonist, CTX-B. Immunocytochemistry and ARS were used to visualize targeted proteins and calcium deposits. Real-time PCR detected expression levels of odontogenic and mineralization markers such as DSPP and DMP-1. Our data indicate that CaMKII inhibition enhances TrkB protein levels and promotes TNF\u03b1-induced transcriptional activation of genes associated with odontogenic differentiation. CaMKII knockdown via siRNA and pharmacological inhibition elevated DSPP and DMP-1 protein levels, whereas CaMKII overexpression suppressed their expression. Notably, treatment with TNF-\u03b1 and a CaMKII inhibitor upregulated DSPP and DMP-1 expression, while co-treatment with CTX-B abolished this effect. Similarly, mRNA expression of DSPP and DMP-1 was reduced at day 10. Mineralization activity exhibited a similar pattern to the expression of these markers. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism underlying the role of CaMKII via TrkB in dentinogenesis, which is vital for the success of hDPSCs engineering strategies.",

          "title": "Linagliptin mitigates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute kidney injury in mice: Novel renal BDNF/TrkB/NRF2-dependent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mechanisms.",
          "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication associated with sepsis, yet no effective treatment is currently available. The primary mechanisms involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic AKI are oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the potential renoprotective effects of linagliptin, an antidiabetic dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor, against LPS-induced AKI with special emphasis on renal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) axis. Mice were divided into control, LPS, LPS\u00a0+\u00a0linagliptin, and LPS\u00a0+\u00a0linagliptin+ANA-12 (tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) antagonist) groups. Our results revealed that linagliptin, partially through BDNF augmentation, ameliorated AKI, evidenced by the improved histological structure and function of the kidney where serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and renal kidney injury molecule-1were decreased with increased serum albumin. These improvements result from glucagon-like peptide-1/BDNF/TrkB-mediated NRF2 activation, enhancing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic pathways. Linagliptin, through NRF2 augmentation, suppressed renal myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, NLR Family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome, nuclear factor-kappaB, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)-associated X protein, while boosting the antioxidant glutathione and the antiapoptotic Bcl2 contents. The administration of ANA-12 before linagliptin partially reversed these beneficial effects. Accordingly, our results suggest that linagliptin has therapeutic potential in managing LPS-induced AKI. Furthermore, they provide insights into its underlying mechanisms, highlighting renal BDNF signaling as a potential therapeutic target through downstream NRF2 enhancement and its associated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous malignant pediatric tumor, the prognosis of which depends on patient age and disease stage. Current treatment strategies rely on four key diagnostic criteria: age, histological stage, genomic profile, and MYCN gene status. The oncogenic activity of MYC depends on ribosome biogenesis, which is hyperactivated in cancer cells to support their high proliferative capacity, and which may thus represent a vulnerability in neuroblastoma and constitute a therapeutic target. Here, using the well-established IMR-32 cell line along with a previously established panel of patient-derived neuroblastoma cell lines with varying MYCN status, we show that RNA polymerase I inhibition following exposure to CX-5461 and BMH-21 suppressed cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations and induced ribosomal stress, leading to the activation of apoptosis and the p21 pathway. Furthermore, analysis of expression of ribosome biogenesis factors using publicly available datasets and RT-qPCR data from an in-house neuroblastoma cohort, we identified FBL as a marker of poor prognosis in neuroblastoma. Consistently, FBL knockdown reduced neuroblastoma cell proliferation, supporting its relevance as a therapeutic target. In conclusion, our study reinforces the therapeutic potential of ribosome biogenesis inhibition in neuroblastoma and expands the list of potential targets to include rRNA maturation factors. These findings highlight the relevance of targeting ribosome biogenesis as a novel approach for neuroblastoma treatment.",

          "abstract": "The twelfth multi-stakeholder Paediatric Strategy focused on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. Genetic aberrations in paediatric tumours increase CDK4/6 activity, thus the pathway is a therapeutic target. As a result, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials for children and young adults with different malignancies, both as single agents and in combination, including molecular enrichment in ESMART. In some instances, trials of different agents within this same class are very similar in design or target population, leading to duplication. Consistent with preclinical data with CDK4/6 inhibitors which mostly demonstrate cytostasis, but not tumour regression, objective responses are rare, although there may be slowing of tumour growth. Similar to adults, no predictive biomarkers have been identified and an integrated comprehensive clinical development strategy of this class of agents is lacking. Patient advocates believe that the many trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors, which have enrolled many children and young people, have not been matched by sufficient gains in knowledge. CDK9, CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors, based on exploitation of transcriptional vulnerabilities, have shown promise in preclinical models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma and translocation fusion-driven malignancies. The development of these inhibitors should be sequential, iterative and coordinated, including early engagement with regulators. In conclusion, there needs to be prioritisation and coordination of any further development of CDK4/6 inhibitors in paediatric malignancies. Definite tumour regression in preclinical models, not just cytostasis, should be taken as the go/no go decision point to progress such agents to clinical studies. Based on limited single agent activity in preclinical models, trials of new inhibitors should avoid unnecessary exposure of patients to monotherapy and rapidly progress to combination strategies, while retaining designs that allow early evaluation of activity. A framework to support integrated development strategies of new products across sponsors would be very beneficial.",

Nearly half of high-risk tumors present with amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene. Here, we describe a Mycn-driven, transplantable, non-germline, genetically engineered mouse model (Mycn-nGEMM). Mycn-nGEMM tumors recapitulate the immune-evasive, macrophage-rich tumor microenvironment of high-risk, MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with anti-PD-L1, but not anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4, inhibited tumor growth, profoundly remodeling the tumor microenvironment by depleting anti-inflammatory macrophages and increasing T cell infiltration. Surprisingly, while tumor cells showed low expression of PD-L1, anti-inflammatory macrophages from both murine and human neuroblastoma expressed PD-L1. We identified cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor, secreted by the Mycn-nGEMM cancer cells that drive expression of PD-L1 on macrophages. Combining anti-PD-L1 with CD40 agonist antibodies further improved survival in Mycn-nGEMM mice, demonstrating the potential for myeloid-targeting immunotherapies to overcome inhibitory barriers in immune-evasive neuroblastoma.",

          "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastoma accounts for about 15% of childhood cancer deaths and arises from precursors of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Retinoids are clinically used to inhibit growth of neuroblastoma cells through reconfiguration of the regulatory enhancer landscape. Its effects, however, are completely reversible after drug withdrawal, leading to rapid tumor cell proliferation. Here, we sought to identify epigenetic modifiers that potentiate the antiproliferative effects of retinoids in neuroblastoma. We identified PF-9363, an inhibitor of the histone H3K23 acetyltransferases KAT6A/B, as synergistically inhibiting neuroblastoma growth in combination with retinoids. PF-9363 plus retinoids induces durable growth arrest, which persists beyond retinoid withdrawal  and  with sustained Polycomb-mediated repression of oncogenic transcription factors MYCN, PHOX2B and GATA3. Moreover, PF-9363 plus retinoids increases GD2 expression, rendering neuroblastoma cells more sensitive to anti-GD2 immunotherapy. Overall, our studies demonstrate that KAT6A/B inhibition increases the effectiveness of retinoids and GD2-targeted immunotherapy in neuroblastoma.",

          "abstract": "MYCN amplification, a characteristic of aggressive neuroblastoma, presents therapeutic challenges. This study uncovered the potential effects of a fructose metabolite, acetate, on the transcriptional regulation of MYCN expression, which is still largely unexplored. We elucidated the pivotal role of acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), found to be heightened in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. We demonstrated that ACSS2 enhanced MYCN gene transcription and growth of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Our results revealed a new mechanism wherein ACSS2 orchestrates MYCN transcription by escalating acetyl-CoA levels and histone acetylation, hinting at a metabolic participation in forcibly dictating MYCN regulation. We further demonstrated that fructose or acetate exacerbated neuroblastoma growth, which can be halted by the ACSS2 inhibitor. We further identified the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) as the trigger for ACSS2 induction through the Akt-SREBP-1 pathway. Our findings propose NgBR as a novel therapeutic target, emphasizing the promising potential of metabolic therapies for managing aggressive MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.",

          "abstract": "BMI1, a constituent of polycomb repressive complex 1, is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including neuroblastoma, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer therapeutics. Given the pivotal role of BMI1, a number of inhibitors have been synthesized and assessed for therapeutic efficacy across a spectrum of cancers. In our present study, the BMI1 inhibitors PTC-028 and PTC-209 exhibited selective antitumor activity against MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Notably, PTC-028, which exhibited toxicity at lower concentrations, triggered apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells and induced G1-phase accumulation, along with reductions in S-phase and G2/M-phase populations, thereby promoting cell cycle arrest. Thorough RNA sequencing analyses revealed that PTC-028 treatment activated the p53 signaling pathway, suggesting it plays a critical role in the mechanism of apoptosis induction. Moreover, PTC-028 treatment led to decreases in levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL2 and MCL1. Significantly, PTC-028 also exhibited antitumor efficacy in a mouse xenograft model of human neuroblastoma. These results suggest that BMI1 inhibitors, particularly PTC-028, are promising therapeutic agents for the management of aggressive MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas.",

          "abstract": "Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is recognized for its pivotal involvement in various cancer types, with Protein Kinase Inhibitor Beta (PKIB) serving as an endogenous inhibitor that curtails PKA activity. Despite the documented escalation of PKIB expression in several malignancies, a comprehensive understanding of its precise mechanistic implications in human cancers remains elusive. This investigation is centered on bladder cancer (BLCA), unveiling an augmented expression of PKIB concomitant with heightened BLCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and augmented tumorigenic potential in an in vivo model. Mechanistically, PKIB disrupts PKA kinase activity, thereby resulting in diminished phosphorylation of the substrate target protein HSP27 at serine 15, 78, and 82. Additionally, the transcription factor MYCN exhibits an affinity for the PKIB promoter, leading to its enhanced expression in the context of BLCA. These findings reveal the oncogenic proclivity of PKIB and introduce a novel signalling pathway in BLCA, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for precise intervention.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer with a high relapse rate despite intensive treatment. TRPA1 is a pain-sensing ion channel with downstream impacts on proliferative and pro-apoptotic pathways. Here, we evaluated TRPA1 expression in NB and performed pharmacological inhibition in preclinical models to assess its potential as a therapeutic target in NB. METHODS: TRPA1 protein levels were assessed in NB patient tumors on tissue microarrays. Bulk and single-cell gene expression data were retrieved from publicly available databases. The effects of three TRPA1 inhibitors (AP-18, A967079, and Bay 390) on NB cell viability and cell death were evaluated using NB patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived organoids. In vivo testing was performed in a MYCN-amplified NB PDX model. Drug combination testing was performed using combination or sequential treatments and evaluated using drug synergy scores. RESULTS: TRPA1 is widely expressed in NB patient tumors and preclinical patient-derived NB models. Pharmacological TRPA1 inhibition decreased NB cell viability and increased cell death. In vivo TRPA1 inhibition alone did not significantly affect NB tumor growth. Pretreatment with TRPA1 inhibition prior to chemotherapy resulted in synergistic effects in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: TRPA1 is expressed in NB tumors, and pharmacological TRPA1 inhibition can be effective in vitro and synergistic when used as pretreatment to chemotherapy. However, the tested inhibitors did not show in vivo efficacy, at least as monotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous childhood cancer, characterized by the amplification of the  oncogene in 40% of the high-risk cases. Our previous work demonstrated that MYCN drives metabolic reprogramming in NB, including upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Here, we identify peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) as a promising therapeutic target in NB. Pharmacological inhibition of PRDX6 reduces MYCN levels, induces apoptosis, and promotes neuronal differentiation accompanied by lipid droplet accumulation, essential for the phenotypic reprogramming. Moreover, combined inhibition of PRDX6 and glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1), a key antioxidant enzyme needed for PRDX6 activation, demonstrated synergistic effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy results in neuronal maturation as well as activity and initiates downstream pathways distinct from the ones triggered by retinoic acid, the differentiation-inducing agent currently used in clinical practice for NB. Notably, both  and  are highly expressed in the developing murine adrenal gland, as well as in high-risk, -amplified NB, correlating with an undifferentiated state and poor prognosis. Together, our results provide insights into the potential of PRDX6 and GSTP1 as therapeutic targets for differentiation induction for children with NB.",

          "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastoma is a poor prognosis cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for a disproportionate number of childhood cancer deaths. Many viable biological targets have been identified, and the number of potential combinations is even larger. Several products have attained marketing authorization for treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. Patient outcomes remain poor, with approximately 50% of children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma cured of their disease. International, multistakeholder Neuroblastoma Drug Development Strategy (NDDS) meetings were established more than a decade ago. This third NDDS meeting included academia, industry, regulatory, and patient advocacy representatives to prioritize agents and to address key challenges in drug development in this disease. Given the central role that anti-GD2 therapy plays, novel GD2-directed combinations were a key focus, including epigenetic enzymes such as EZH2 and immunologic targets such as IL15 and TIGIT as potential combination partners. GD2-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells were a top priority, along with emerging CAR-T targets such as B7-H3 and GPC2. Recognizing that combination therapies are likely to be most impactful for patients and for advancing therapies to frontline, another key focus was on high priority combinations of targeted therapies, including Aurora A kinase plus BCL2 or ATR inhibitors. Additional targets and agents were prioritized or deprioritized based upon current data. Access to drugs for clinical trials was viewed as a major barrier to progress. Strategies to overcome this challenge focused on united efforts by the international scientific and advocacy community and early engagement by industry with regulatory authorities.",

          "abstract": "The N-Myc gene MYCN amplification accounts for the most common genetic aberration in neuroblastoma and strongly predicts the aggressive progression and poor clinical prognosis. However, clinically effective therapies that directly target N-Myc activity are limited. N-Myc is a transcription factor, and its stability is tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation. Here, we discovered that Kelch-like protein 37 (KLHL37) played a crucial role in enhancing the protein stability of N-Myc in neuroblastoma. KLHL37 directly interacted with N-Myc to disrupt N-Myc-FBXW7 interaction, thereby stabilizing N-Myc and enabling tumor progression. Suppressing KLHL37 effectively induced the degradation of N-Myc and had a profound inhibitory effect on the growth of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Notably, we identified RTA-408 as an inhibitor of KLHL37 to disrupt the KLHL37-N-Myc complex, promoting the degradation of N-Myc and suppressing neuroblastoma in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we elucidated the therapeutic potential of RTA-408 for neuroblastoma using patient-derived neuroblastoma cell and patient-derived xenograft tumor models. RTA408's antitumor effects may not occur exclusively via KLHL37, and specific KLHL37 inhibitors are expected to be developed in the future. These findings not only uncover the biological function of KLHL37 in regulating N-Myc stability, but also indicate that KLHL37 inhibition is a promising therapeutic regimen for neuroblastoma, especially in patients with MYCN-amplified tumors.",

Our analysis demonstrates that CRISPR-Cas9 nickase can generate a lethal number of highly toxic, replication-dependent double-strand breaks in cells harboring amplified loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickase-mediated toxicity can be modulated in combination with small molecule inhibitors targeting key regulators of the DNA-damage response or cell death pathways. Importantly, our findings in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma translate to other cancer types with distinct oncogene amplifications.",

          "abstract": "Despite Myc oncoproteins being major causal factors in human cancer, they remain \"undruggable.\" The  oncogene is one of the most powerful prognostic markers for the childhood cancer neuroblastoma and represents an important target for developing novel therapeutics. Here, we report the finding and characterization of M606, a selective small molecule inhibitor of MYCN, which was identified by screening a diverse chemical library. M606 reduced MYCN protein levels in neuroblastoma cell lines and upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A). Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of , , or  in HepG2 and BE(2)-C cells followed by M606 treatment, we demonstrated that Myc downregulation and HIF1A upregulation were two independent effects of M606 treatment. M606 selectively targeted neuroblastoma cell lines expressing higher levels of MYCN protein and delayed neuroblastoma development in the  transgenic mouse model. Metabolomic analysis showed that M606 modulated glucose metabolism, consistent with a hypoxic response and iron deprivation. Biochemical characterization of M606 not only confirmed its iron-chelating properties but also revealed its ability to downregulate  promoter activity, which could be rescued by the addition of iron. Luciferase assays identified the minimal  promoter region required for the M606 response, which contained overlapping E2F transcription factor binding sites. Further evaluation defined a key role for E2F3 in the M606-mediated response. The finding of a potent cell-permeable iron chelator that can chelate iron to directly downregulate  transcription via an E2F3-mediated response represents a potentially valuable therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancers overexpressing Myc oncoproteins.",

          "abstract": "Cutaneous angiosarcoma (CAS) is a life-threatening neoplasm with a 5-year survival rate of under 40% in advanced cases. As available treatments for CAS are limited, novel therapeutics must be explored. To identify potential therapeutic candidates, we conducted a drug screening analysis using an angiosarcoma cell line, HAMON. Cancer-related gene analysis revealed alterations in FGFR4, MYCN, CDKN2A, NF1, TP53, KDM6A, ATRX, MSH6, ATM, and NOTCH1 in HAMON cells. Screening of 4681 FDA-approved drugs identified four candidate compounds, with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib selected for further study. ATP and MTT assays revealed bortezomib to be the most effective candidate against HAMON cells. Clonogenic assays revealed fewer HAMON cell colonies in the range of 1-10\u2009nM bortezomib. DNA-content fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed a notable increase in the sub-G0/G1 phases, suggesting cell death without cell cycle arrest. Annexin V-propidium iodide staining revealed a significant increase in the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells in the bortezomib group. Mechanistically, bortezomib induced activation of NF-\u03baB and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling. The administration of bortezomib to immunocompromised mice implanted with HAMON cells induced apoptosis of tumor cells. This study identified the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as a potential candidate for angiosarcoma in vitro and in vivo.",

          "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastoma remains a clinically challenging pediatric cancer, with an approximate five-year survival rate of ~60%. Frontline therapy for this group of patients includes surgery and intensive chemotherapy that involves combinations of the tubulin inhibitor vincristine with several other chemotherapeutics. Unfortunately, unresponsiveness to therapy and relapse are common, with tumors often displaying resistance to vincristine. Recently, we characterized a novel set of tubulin inhibitors that are distinct from vincristine and bind within the colchicine binding site present on tubulin monomers. Colchicine binding site inhibitors (CBSIs) have gained traction as improved chemotherapeutics due to their potential to overcome tubulin inhibitor-induced resistance. In this study, we investigate the functional impact of CBSI treatment on multiple neuroblastoma cell lines, including those that are vincristine-resistant. We demonstrate that our newly developed compounds are effective at disrupting cell division in non-resistant and resistant cells and have cellular activity against vincristine-resistant cell lines. Interestingly, we find that vincristine-resistant cell lines differ in their ability to undergo apoptotic cell death in response to CBSI treatment. Taken together, these findings provide a solid foundation to further investigate the utility of CBSIs for neuroblastoma treatment, while highlighting the distinct resistance mechanisms that can emerge in these childhood cancers.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In neuroblastoma MYCN amplification is associated with enhanced angiogenesis and poor survival. Mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene can occur with MYCN amplification, conferring a very poor prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET signalling are implicated in neuroblastoma progression. Cabozantinib has potent activity against VEGFR2 and MET. METHODS: The efficacy of cabozantinib against tumours arising in GEM models of high-risk neuroblastoma was assessed using multiparametric MRI. Tumour-bearing Th-MYCN and Th-ALK/Th-MYCN mice were imaged prior to, 24 and 48 hrs after treatment with either 30mg/kg/day cabozantinib or vehicle. Treatment-induced changes in tumour volume, native T, R* and ADC were evaluated, and histological correlates sought. Additional Th-MYCN mice were treated daily for up to 28 days. RESULTS: Cabozantinib elicited significant 24 and 60 % growth delay 24 and 48 hrs after treatment in tumours in Th-MYCN mice, and a significant 6-8 % reduction in native T. Tumour R* was significantly reduced 48 hrs post-treatment. Significantly higher tumour necrosis and apoptosis, and significantly lower Ki67, CD34 and VEGFR2 staining, was determined from the cabozantinib-treated mice. Treatment of Th-ALK/Th-MYCN mice caused significant 4 % and 21 % tumour growth delay, and a significant 5 % reduction in native T at 48 hrs. Daily cabozantinib treatment of Th-MYCN mice elicited significant tumour growth delay over 7 days which translated into significant survival benefit. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib exhibits activity against neuroblastomas arising in both Th-MYCN and Th-MYCN/ALK mice, revealed in situ using MRI. Native T is an early, sensitive and clinically translatable imaging biomarker of effective treatment response in neuroblastoma.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB), the common extracranial solid tumor in children, is associated with a poor prognosis, particularly in high-risk patients. MYCN amplification stands as the most prominent molecular hallmark within this high-risk subgroup. However, MYCN protein is considered \"undruggable\" due to its lack of a conventional enzymatic binding pocket and its predominant nuclear localization, which precludes targeting by standard small-molecule inhibitors or antibody-based therapeutics. Consequently, current therapeutic strategies have achieved limited efficacy against MYCN-driven NB. Notably, MYCN not only orchestrates diverse metabolic reprogramming pathways in tumors but also exerts a pivotal influence on cellular differentiation. To overcome this therapeutic barrier, we seek to elucidate the contribution of purine metabolism to stemness maintenance in MYCN-amplified NBs and to discover novel small-molecule inhibitors capable of inducing differentiation in high-risk NBs. METHODS: Metabolomic profiling via mass spectrometry was employed to delineate differential metabolite signatures between MYCN-amplified and non-amplified NB cells. Bioinformatics analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing datasets facilitated the systematic evaluation of purine metabolic enzyme expression. Cell differentiation, proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration assays were employed to assess the inhibitor's effects. Additionally, an in\u00a0vivo xenograft model of NB was established to examine the therapeutic potential of lometrexol (LMX), a selective inhibitor of the purine biosynthesis enzyme phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART). RESULTS: Significant changes in nucleotide metabolism were identified in NB cell lines with high MYCN expression compared to those with low MYCN expression. The expression of purine metabolic enzyme genes was positively correlated with MYCN expression, prognosis, and differentiation status in NBs. Pharmacological inhibition of GART using LMX elicited a robust pro-differentiation response, concomitant with a significant suppression of tumorigenic potential. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish purine metabolic enzyme inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy to induce differentiation and attenuate tumor progression in high-risk MYCN-amplified NBs.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonic malignancy causing 15\u00a0% of pediatric cancer fatalities. Amplification of the MYCN gene is one of the major NB drivers and biomarkers of high-risk NB. MYCN amplification is associated with high p53-coding gene expression and decreased survival rates in patients. Importantly, only 1-2\u00a0% of NB cases harbor TP53 mutations. Moreover, both high TP53 and low MYC expression levels are unfavorable prognostic markers for NB patients, which is not typical for most types of tumors. In this study we analyzed the effect of MYCN amplification on the expression of genes coding p53 family members - TP63 and TP73. We show that, unlike TP53, TP63 and TP73 levels are higher in MYCN-amplified samples. Furthermore, high TP63 and TP73 expression is a favorable prognostic marker for NB patients' survival. That MDM2 inhibition contributes to p53 stabilization and augments the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin in NB cells prompted us to test the cytotoxic effects of three small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2 that differ in their mechanisms: Nutlin-3a, Mel23, and SP-141. Our results showed that despite the same target, MDM2, these compounds displayed different cytotoxic effects and synergy with doxorubicin on two widely used NB cell lines, IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y that vary in the amount of MDM2 expression. Collectively, our results suggest that except Nutlin-3a, the other two inhibitors, Mel23 and SP-141, employ additional Mdm2-independent mechanisms of cytotoxicity in NB cells that warrants further investigation.",

Chromosomal microarray analysis demonstrated amplification of  in the periaortic lymph node biopsy and amplification of  in the resection specimen. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and a pan-RAF inhibitor, but developed new widespread metastasis and was deceased 22\u2009months after presentation. The combination of the primary  fusion with secondary amplification of  and  is likely to drive the aggressive behavior and metastasis in this case of PACC.",

          "abstract": "Intracellular delivery is a bottleneck in the development of therapeutic peptides and proteins. Here, we demonstrate the efficient delivery of omoMYC, the first MYC inhibitor in clinical trials, using HB, an engineered peptide forming liquid-liquid phase-separated coacervates. HB-SP coacervates facilitate efficient cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of the omoMYC peptide at concentrations lower than those required for spontaneous uptake. Strikingly, omoMYC coacervates result in reduced proliferation and apoptosis induction in the low c-MYC expressing cell lines HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells, but not in HeLa and SK-N-BE(2) cells with high c-MYC/MYCN expression, respectively, suggesting that endogenous MYC/N levels may impact the effects of omoMYC. Importantly, our approach bypasses the need for cell penetration-enhancing chemical modifications, offering a novel strategy for the investigation of peptide drug mechanisms in therapeutic development.",
