      "title": "JAK2 Inhibitors and Emerging Therapies in Graft-Versus-Host Disease: Current Perspectives and Future Directions.",
      "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant barrier to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), contributing to long-term morbidity and non-relapse mortality in both pediatric and adult populations. Central to GVHD pathophysiology is the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, where JAK2 mediates key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and GM-CSF. These cytokines promote donor T cell activation, effector differentiation, and target organ damage. The introduction of ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, has transformed the treatment landscape for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD, leading to improved response rates and durable symptom control. However, its limitations-such as cytopenias, infectious complications, and incomplete responses-have catalyzed the development of next-generation agents. In 2024, the FDA approved axatilimab, a CSF-1R inhibitor that targets monocyte-derived macrophages in fibrotic chronic GVHD, and remestemcel-L, an allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, for pediatric steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Both agents offer mechanistically distinct and clinically meaningful additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. In parallel, emerging combination strategies involving JAK2 inhibitors and novel biologics show promise in enhancing immune tolerance while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects. Recent advances in biomarker development, such as the MAGIC Algorithm Probability (MAP), are enabling early risk stratification and response prediction. The integration of these tools with organ-specific and personalized approaches marks a shift toward more precise, durable, and tolerable GVHD therapy. This review highlights the current state and future direction of JAK2 inhibition and complementary therapies in the evolving GVHD treatment paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic hematologic disorders characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid lineage cells, commonly driven by JAK2 mutations, and associated with significant thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. Women of reproductive age with MPNs face unique challenges in selecting safe and effective contraception, as these disorders inherently increase thrombotic risk and may interact with hormonal contraceptive therapies. Estrogen-containing contraceptives are contraindicated due to their association with venous and arterial thrombosis, while progestin-only and non-hormonal methods are generally safer but must be tailored to individual risks such as thrombocytopenia, prior thrombotic events, and disease-modifying therapies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of contraceptive options for women with MPNs, exploring the thrombotic and bleeding risks associated with different methods and the potential impact of MPN treatments, including JAK2 inhibitors, on contraceptive efficacy. By synthesizing current evidence, the review aims to guide clinicians in optimizing reproductive health for women with MPNs while minimizing the risks of their underlying hematologic condition.",

      "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), as a prevalent and life-threatening malignancy, poses a significant global health burden, particularly impacting patients and their families profoundly. Peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) exhibits high expression levels in LUAD tissues. However, the identification of efficient and low-toxicity small-molecule inhibitors targeting PRDX2 from traditional Chinese medicine remains a challenging task. This study aims to identify potential inhibitors of PRDX2 in lung adenocarcinoma and elucidate their mechanism of action. Molecular docking and thermal shift assays were employed to evaluate the interaction between luteolin and PRDX2 protein. The effects of luteolin on lung cancer cell behavior were assessed through in vitro cellular experiments, and its efficacy on tumor growth was validated in a mouse model. Additionally, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis were utilized to investigate the mechanism of luteolin's action. Molecular docking and thermal shift experiments confirmed the binding affinity of luteolin to PRDX2. In vitro experiments demonstrated that luteolin significantly inhibits the proliferation and migration of LUAD cells. In vivo experiments showed that luteolin effectively suppresses tumor growth in an immunocompetent lung cancer mouse model. Western blot results untangled that luteolin promotes apoptosis of lung cancer cells by enhancing T-cell-mediated killing pathways via PRDX2. In summary, luteolin binds to PRDX2, inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, suppressing PD-L1 expression, promoting the release of perforin and granzyme B from CD8 T cells, and inhibiting immune evasion in LUAD, thereby inhibiting the progression of lung adenocarcinoma.",

      "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRTs), a family of NAD+-dependent enzymes, play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation, metabolism, DNA repair, and stress response, making them relevant to glioma biology. This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms and context-specific functions of SIRT1-SIRT7 in central nervous system tumors, with particular focus on gliomas. SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT5, and SIRT7 are often overexpressed and promote glioma cell proliferation, stemness, therapy resistance, and metabolic adaptation. Conversely, SIRT2, SIRT4, and SIRT6 generally exhibit tumor-suppressive functions by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting invasion, and counteracting oncogenic signaling. Preclinical studies have identified several sirtuin modulators-both inhibitors and activators-that alter tumor growth, sensitize cells to temozolomide, and regulate pathways such as JAK2/STAT3, NF-\u03baB, and mitochondrial metabolism. Emerging evidence positions sirtuins as promising targets for glioma therapy. Future studies should evaluate sirtuin modulators in clinical trials and explore their potential for patient stratification and combined treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often showing limited responses to immunotherapies, notably those targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in modulating PD-L1 expression and its impact on the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. By comprehensively reviewing molecular mechanisms and recent experimental evidence, we investigated how aberrant JAK/STAT activation, through genetic alterations, cytokine-mediated signals, and environmental influences, drives PD-L1 upregulation and contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Our findings reveal that enhanced JAK/STAT signaling facilitates immune evasion by promoting transcriptional activation of PD-L1 and supporting oncogenic processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Conversely, impaired JAK/STAT function can diminish PD-L1 expression, thereby altering the sensitivity of tumor cells to checkpoint blockade. Importantly, preclinical studies highlighted the potential of combination therapeutic strategies that target both the JAK/STAT pathway and PD-L1 to restore effective T cell responses and overcome resistance to immunotherapy. These insights underscore the need for tailored treatment approaches that integrate JAK/STAT inhibitors with PD-L1 blockade, potentially paving the way for improved clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) refers to blood generation outside of the bone marrow (BM). In Myelofibrosis (MF), a myeloproliferative neoplasm, the disruption of BM microenvironment promotes haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) mobilisation, resulting in the onset of EMH in the spleen, and then in splenomegaly. Although JAK2 inhibitors have a good efficacy in reducing splenomegaly, the presence of a significant proportion of non-responder patients underlines the need to explore the cellular mechanisms responsible for the EMH onset. In a MF mouse model, Ruxolitinib induces a reduction in spleen volume but does not affect EMH. CD44 inhibition successfully reduces monocyte and HSPC migration in an in\u00a0vitro extravasation model. Strikingly, MF monocytes are more effective in promoting HSPC migration through the production of hyaluronic acid. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CD44 regulates the migration of monocytes that are crucial for the onset of EMH in MF patients, as they produce CD44 ligands recruiting HSPCs from the BM.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Myeloid Leukemias.",
      "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have transformed outcomes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), yet durable remissions are curtailed by the emergence of drug resistance. This review summarizes the principal mechanisms that underlie that resistance. In CML, the most common mechanism is the development of point mutations in the BCR::ABL1 kinase domain (KD). Additional layers of resistance arise when imatinib, a substrate for the P-glycoprotein\u00a0(P-gp) efflux pump, is shunted out of the intracellular space\u00a0and when leukemic cells engage alternative signaling pathways such as the SIRT1 and JAK2-STAT5. Up-regulation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway and epigenetic changes such as HOXA4 and PDLIM4 promoter hypermethylation have likewise been linked to TKI resistance. FLT3-mutated AML shows a parallel yet distinct pattern. One of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibitors is point mutations in FLT3 itself; the gatekeeper F691L, N676K and K429E substitutions cause resistance to clinically used FLT3 inhibitors. Resistance is also driven by activation of alternative signaling cascades: RAS/MAPK and IDH2-associated pathways frequently emerge and make FLT3 inhibition less effective. After initial therapy, clonal selection allows inhibitor-insensitive subclones to dominate, while bone-marrow stromal factors, high CYP3A4 activity together with FGF2/FGFR1-mediated MAPK signaling, protect blasts from FLT3 inhibitors. It is important to study the mechanisms of resistance responsible for treatment failure to develop therapeutic strategies to overcome this resistance. This paper aims to review the important mechanisms of resistance to TKIs, both in CML and AML.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosis and treatment of chronic myeloid neoplasms with two concurrently present driver mutations is challenging. We report on 10 JAK2 V617F/BCR::ABL1 patients in whom both mutations were identified simultaneously in 5/10 (50%) patients or in whom BCR::ABL1 appeared a median of 14 years after the primary diagnosis of JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) in the remaining 5 patients. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) analysis demonstrated subsequent acquisition of BCR::ABL1 in a pre-existing JAK2 V617F clone in 8/9 (89%) of evaluable patients. Despite the presence of JAK2 V617F in all patients, atypical BCR::ABL1 transcripts (e1a2/e19a2) in 3/9 (33%) patients and additional somatic mutations in 5/9 (56%) patients, molecular remission of BCR::ABL1 was achieved with different ABL1 TKIs (imatinib, n\u2009=\u20092, dasatinib, n\u2009=\u20092, nilotinib, n\u2009=\u20093) in 7/9 (78%) patients. During a total of 217 months of treatment, concomitant treatment with ABL1 TKIs and ruxolitinib did not affect dosing, efficacy or side effects. We conclude that (i) a second driver mutation might occur in chronic phase MPNs, (ii) clonality analyses largely support a common disease origin, and (iii) the dose, efficacy and safety of ABL1 inhibitors and ruxolitinib are not mutually affected by concurrent treatment.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory skin disorder characterized by an impaired skin barrier, dysregulated immune system and pruritis. Emerging pharmaceutical therapies for AD include selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as ruxolitinib, the first dual JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ruxolitinib on AD-related symptoms using mouse and human skin models. AD-related symptoms were assessed in MC903/ruxolitinib-treated mice, including ear swelling, histological analysis, pruritus, serum biomarker quantification and immune cell analysis. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and transcriptome analysis were conducted on AD-related cytokine-treated reconstructed human skin (RHS) and ruxolitinib-treated human skin explants with and without tape-stripping. Ruxolitinib-treated mice exhibited reduced inflammation, including decreased ear swelling and diminished pruritus. Furthermore, reductions in immune cell populations, including T cells and serum biomarker IL-13, were observed in ruxolitinib-treated mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed increased STAT3 expression and decreased skin barrier gene FLG in AD-related cytokine-treated RHS. Regardless of tape stripping, ruxolitinib-treated skin explants exhibited decreased IL13RA1 expression and increased expression of skin barrier genes FLG, FLG2 and LOR. Ruxolitinib treatment in mice resulted in decreased inflammation and pruritus, along with increased expression of skin barrier proteins through downregulation of IL-13. Consistently, ruxolitinib-treated human skin explants demonstrated enhanced expression of skin barrier proteins, while IL-13 treatment of RHS led to downregulation of these proteins. These findings support data from human clinical trials indicating reduced SCORAD, pruritus and inflammatory phenotypes in AD patients treated with ruxolitinib.",

Hydroxysafflor Yellow A (HYSA), extracted from Carthamus tinctorius L, has shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties effective in treating sepsis, though its precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, a cecum ligation puncture (CLP) model was used to evaluate HYSA's effects on sepsis-induced organ injury. HYSA (300\u00a0mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 4\u00a0h post-CLP. Results showed that HYSA inhibited the inflammatory response and improved pathological scores in the liver, lungs, and kidneys. Metabolomics analysis identified key metabolites and pathways influenced by HYSA, including nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and glycine/serine metabolism. Network pharmacology and molecular docking identified JAK2/STAT1 as potential targets, with Western blotting confirmed that HYSA inhibits JAK2/STAT1 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that HYSA protects against sepsis-induced organ injury by regulating metabolic networks and modulating the JAK2/STAT1 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Chemoresistance and metastasis are key obstacles to successful ovarian cancer (OC) treatment. Here, \u03b1-Hederin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin, is identified as a potent and selective dual inhibitor of JAK1/JAK2 with promising therapeutic potential in OC. Integrating transcriptomic analysis, virtual screening, molecular docking, and biochemical validation, it is shown that \u03b1-Hederin directly binds the JH1 kinase domains of JAK1 and JAK2, suppressing their activity and downstream STAT3 phosphorylation. \u03b1-Hederin inhibits OC cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis in vitro, and suppresses tumor growth and dissemination in multiple mouse models, with minimal systemic toxicity. Mechanistically, \u03b1-Hederin blocks STAT3 nuclear translocation and downregulates oncogenic STAT3 targets including MYC, CCND1, and TWIST1. Rescue experiments using the STAT3 agonist Colivelin partially reversed these effects, confirming the JAK/STAT3 axis as a key target. Moreover, \u03b1-Hederin synergizes with cisplatin to enhance antitumor efficacy and overcomes platinum resistance in OC cells. Collectively, our findings highlight \u03b1-Hederin as a safe and effective natural JAK1/2 inhibitor that suppresses OC progression by targeting the JAK/STAT3 pathway, offering a compelling candidate for future clinical translation.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase 2 inhibitor (JAK2i) used in patients with primary myelofibrosis. This treatment is a risk factor for bacterial and viral infections, and can reactivate latent infections, such as tuberculosis. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 80-year-old patient hospitalized for disseminated tuberculosis. He had been treated for 28\u00a0months with ruxolitinib for JAK2-muted primary myelofibrosis. Pre-therapeutic screening for latent tuberculosis infection had not been performed. Sixteen months after starting ruxolitinib, bone, peritoneal, and lymph node lesions appeared. Finally, the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis was made 12\u00a0months after the first secondary lesions were observed. By then, tuberculosis had caused diffuse peritoneal involvement, staged lymph node involvement, pleuropulmonary, muscular, and especially multiple bone lesions with destruction of the 6th thoracic vertebra. A treatment with quadruple antituberculosis therapy led to slow improvement. Ruxolitinib was discontinued. CONCLUSION: Before initiating treatment with ruxolitinib, an immunological test for latent tuberculosis infection should be systematically performed, even in a country with a low tuberculosis incidence.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by profound neuronal and cognitive decline, with increasing evidence implicating astrocyte dysfunction in disease pathology. While traditional therapeutic approaches have primarily targeted neurons, the crucial role of astrocytes in metabolism, neurotransmission, amyloid-beta clearance, and neuroinflammation underscores their potential as therapeutic targets. In this study, we employed a multiomic integrative analysis combining transcriptomic and kinomic profiling of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes from patients with familial AD (fAD) compared to healthy controls (HCs). Our transcriptomic analysis identified 1249 significantly differentially expressed genes, highlighting a pronounced upregulation of inflammatory genes (, , , ) and a concomitant downregulation of genes essential for synaptic support and ion channel function (, , , ). Kinomic profiling revealed dysregulated kinase activities within DYRK, GSK, and MAPK families, further implicating altered kinase signaling pathways in astrocyte dysfunction. Integration of these datasets pinpointed critical molecular hubs, notably within the PI3K signaling and inflammatory pathways, highlighting targets such as , , and  as potential modulators of disease progression. Furthermore, leveraging the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) platform, we identified chemical perturbagens, including fluticasone propionate and Akt inhibitors, capable of reversing the transcriptomic signatures associated with fAD astrocytes. This integrative multiomic approach not only enhances our understanding of astrocyte-specific molecular mechanisms in AD but also provides novel targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at mitigating astrocyte-driven neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Platycodon grandiflorus polysaccharides combined with hesperidin exerted the synergistic effect of relieving ulcerative colitis in mice by modulating PI3K/AKT and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways.",
      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a complex etiology, characterized by intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Platycodon grandiflorus polysaccharides (PGP), the primary component of Platycodon grandiflorus, and hesperidin (Hesp), a prominent active component in Citrus aurantium L. (CAL), have both demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effect of PGP combined with Hesp on UC, focusing on the coordinated interaction between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways. A mouse model of UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and a cell model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7/IEC6 cells were employed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of PGP combined with Hesp on UC and its potential mechanism of action. The results indicated that compared to the effects of either drug alone, the combination of PGP and Hesp significantly modulated inflammatory factor levels, inhibited oxidative stress, regulated colonic mucosal immunity, suppressed apoptosis, and restored intestinal barrier function in vitro and in vivo. Further in vitro studies revealed that PGP significantly inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, while Hesp significantly inhibited the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The use of inhibitors and activators targeting both pathways validated the synergistic effects of PGP combined with Hesp on the PI3K/AKT and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. These findings suggest that PGP combined with Hesp exhibits a synergistic effect on DSS-induced colitis, potentially mediated through the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/PI3K/AKT and interleukin-6 (IL-6)/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors have gained regulatory approval for treating various human diseases. While the JAK2/signal tranducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway plays a role in tumorigenesis, JAK2/STAT3 inhibitors have shown limited therapeutic efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we assessed the antiproliferative effects of clinically approved JAK2 inhibitors in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T) using the MTT assay. Among the four JAK2 inhibitors evaluated (fedratinib, cerdulatinib, peficitinib, and filgotinib), fedratinib significantly inhibited the proliferation of TNBC cells with IC values below 2 \u03bcM. Fedratinib also demonstrated superior efficacy in inhibiting long-term colony formation compared to other JAK2 inhibitors. Western blot analyses showed that fedratinib uniquely inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and moderately affects the MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, in addition to targeting JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Moreover, fedratinib distinctly decreased MYC and cyclin D1 protein levels while inducing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and apoptotic cell death more effectively than other JAK2 inhibitors. We next investigated the effects of simultaneously inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 together with the MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT pathways, as well as the impact of triple pathway inhibition. Notably, combining ceduratinib with either cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) and ipatasertib (AKT inhibitor) or trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and alpelisib (PI3K inhibitor) mimicked the effects of fedratinib on the cell proliferation, MYC and cyclin D1 suppression, and pro-apoptotic protein induction. These finding suggest that JAK2 inhibition enhances the anticancer effects of concurrent MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition, while JAK2 inhibition alone shows minimal efficacy in TNBC cells.",

      "abstract": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are challenging to treat due to the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and lack of curative therapies. Current treatments fail to eliminate malignant clones and face issues like drug resistance. This study addressed these challenges by identifying USP5 as a critical regulator in JAK2-mutated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which promotes proliferation by suppressing Caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. We developed engineered exosomes (USP5@Exosome-CP) co-expressing CXCR4 and a P-selectin-targeting peptide to enhance BM targeting. These exosomes, loaded with the USP5 inhibitor USP5-IN-1, demonstrated efficient BM homing and sustained drug release. In MPN mouse models, USP5@Exosome-CP significantly reduced MSC proliferation, extended survival, and showed minimal systemic toxicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that USP5 knockdown activated apoptosis pathways and suppressed oncogenic signaling. Our results establish USP5 as a therapeutic target and validate the engineered exosome platform as a promising strategy for MPN treatment, offering a blueprint for targeting other hematologic malignancies. This approach combines USP5 inhibition with BM-targeted nanotechnology, providing a proof-of-concept for personalized MPN therapy with improved efficacy and reduced off-target effects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most prevalent invasive primary brain tumor in adults, is characterized by high mortality, frequent recurrence, and short survival time. The effectiveness of temozolomide (TMZ) in treating GBM is compromised by chemoresistance. Elevated levels of O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and the activation of signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) have been associated with GBM\u2019s resistance to TMZ chemotherapy. Although siramesine (Sira) has demonstrated antitumor activity in various cancers, its potential therapeutic effect in gliomas remains uncertain. METHODS: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), healing assay, and clone formation assay were utilized to assess the cell viability, proliferation, and migration of glioma cells. RNAseq, molecular docking analysis, pull-down assay, qPCR, and pharmacologic treatment were employed to explore the cell signaling pathway. Tumor growth and STAT3 signaling pathway proteins in U87-MG cell-derived xenografts from nude mice were examined using Western blot. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that Sira reduces cell viability, inhibits proliferation and migration, and induces autophagy in GBM cells. Sira promotes GBM cell death by binding to STAT3 and inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT3(Y705). Combination therapy of TMZ and Sira synergistically induced cell death and inhibited GBM cell proliferation and migration, potentially linked to decreased p-STAT3(Y705) and MGMT levels. Furthermore, using STAT3 signaling activators and inhibitors, we confirmed that reduced MGMT levels were mediated by STAT3 inactivation. Cell-derived xenografts from nude mice revealed that Sira did not affect glioma growth. However, it did inhibit the JAK2-STAT3-MGMT signaling pathway and decrease glioma stem cell properties. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Sira inhibits the STAT3-MGMT signaling pathway, slowing tumor growth and increasing sensitivity to TMZ in GBM. These results lay a solid foundation for developing new GBM therapies, with Sira holding promise as a candidate for combined TMZ chemotherapy in GBM.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Regeneration of corticospinal tract (CST) axons after spinal cord injury (SCI) is a key element in rebuilding neuronal connections to restore voluntary motor function. However, it remains challenging owing to limited effective interventions. This study adopted a modified transcranial optogenetic technique to stimulate CST axon regeneration into the injury site of completely transected SCI and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: A novel optogenetic light emitting diode (LED) device was used to stimulate the brain motor cortex in channelrhodopsin-2-yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-YFP) transgenic mice to observe the regeneration of CST axons in the injury site of a complete SCI. The LED device was also used In vitro to stimulate the motor cortex slices of the transgenic mouse brain for observing the outgrowth of their neurites. RESULTS: After transcranial optogenetic stimulation, the pyramidal neurons of bilateral cerebral motor cortices, in ChR2-YFP transgenic mice were activated, CST axons regenerated into the injury site of the spinal cord, and the motor function of the paralyzed hindlimbs improved. Proteomic analysis revealed that CST axon regeneration was associated with the activation of the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway in the cerebral motor cortices. In vitro LED blue light illumination enhanced the outgrowth of neurites from the brain slices of transgenic mice. Treatment with a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor led to a significant attenuation of neurite outgrowth. CONCLUSION: The modified transcranial optogenetic technique stimulated bilateral motor cortices, in the brains of ChR2-YFP transgenic mice. It increased the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the motor cortices, and promoted CST axon regeneration by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, repairing complete SCI.",

      "abstract": "JAK (Janus Kinase) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, were introduced a decade ago for treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). To evaluate ruxolitinib's impact on MPN clonal evolution, we interrogate a myelofibrosis patient cohort with longitudinal molecular evaluation and discover that ruxolitinib is associated with clonal outgrowth of RAS pathway mutations. Single-cell DNA sequencing combined with ex vivo treatment of RAS mutated CD34 primary patient cells, demonstrates that ruxolitinib induces RAS clonal selection both in a JAK/STAT wild-type and hyper-activated context. RAS mutations are associated with decreased transformation-free and overall survival only in patients treated with ruxolitinib. In vitro and in vivo competition assays demonstrate increased cellular fitness of RAS-mutated cells under ruxolitinib or JAK2 knock-down, consistent with an on-target effect. MAPK pathway activation is associated with JAK2 downregulation resulting in enhanced oncogenic potential of RAS mutations. Our results prompt screening for pre-existing RAS mutations in JAK inhibitor treated patients with MPN.",
