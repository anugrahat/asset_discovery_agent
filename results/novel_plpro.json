      "abstract": "We investigated statin-based peptidomimetic compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) by in silico methods, including molecular docking/dynamic simulations and ADMET prediction, as well as enzymatic in vitro assays. Five compounds (LQMed 426, 428, 430, 431, and 432) were identified as having promising interactions with the active site and an allosteric site of PLpro. The docking poses in the active site revealed that the compounds interacted with the catalytic triad (Cys111, His272, and Asp286). Compound 426 stood out for forming significant hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, there was a tendency for the compounds to migrate to a pocket in the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain region, indicating possible allosteric inhibition. Principal component analysis (PCA) and free energy landscape (FEL) plot showed significant differences in the conformational stability of protein-ligand complexes. Complex 432 had the highest stability (PC1: 24.9%, PC2: 10.5%) with restricted movements, while complex 430 had the lowest stability and the highest PC1, indicating broader movements. Complexes 426 and 428 had intermediate stability. FEL analysis confirmed that complex 432 had multiple minimum energy clusters, suggesting a greater likelihood of stable enzyme-ligand complex. In vitro assays demonstrated that all compounds inhibited PLpro activity by at least 50%, with IC values ranging from 0.85 \u00b5M to 4.06 \u00b5M. Compounds 426 and 432 were the most promising, with IC of 0.85 \u00b5M and 1.46 \u00b5M, respectively, values comparable to the GRL-0617 reference inhibitor. Binding free energy analysis indicated that compounds 430 and 431 showed significant affinity for the allosteric site (-27\u00a0kcal/mol and -\u200914\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively), while compound 428 showed reduced stability. In addition, in silico pharmacokinetics and toxicity (ADMET) prediction revealed that statine-based compounds are promising compared to GRL-0617 due to the low potential of inhibition of CYP's family and toxicity risk. Overall, the tested compounds, especially 426 and 432, showed potential as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and may act by non-competitive or mixed mechanisms, making them promising candidates for developing antivirals against CoViD-19.",

      "abstract": "The papain-like protease (PLpro), a cysteine protease found in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), plays a crucial role in viral replication by cleaving the viral polyproteins and interfering with the host's innate immune response through deubiquitination and deISGylation activities. Consequently, targeting PLpro has emerged as an appealing therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite considerable efforts in the development of PLpro inhibitors, there is currently no drug available on the market that specifically targets PLpro. Improving drug screening strategies and identifying additional candidate compounds could significantly contribute to the advancement of antiviral agents targeting PLpro. To address this pressing issue, our present study has developed a highly efficient compound screening strategy based on a supervised machine learning approach. Integrated with further molecular simulation approaches such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations, we have identified seven compounds with potent inhibitory activity against PLpro. Notably, two of these compounds exhibited superior activity compared to Jun12682, which is currently considered the best-performing inhibitor against PLpro. Furthermore, some crucial residues in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were recognized as favorable contributors to the binding with inhibitor, which would provide valuable insights for the development of more potent and highly selective SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors. The compound screening strategy and potential PLpro inhibitor candidates revealed in the present study would hold promise for advancing the development of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.",

      "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) is a multifunctional viral protein that facilitates viral assembly and disrupts host immune responses by removing interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) modifications from target proteins. However, the mechanisms by which PLpro-mediated immune evasion leads to inflammatory responses are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that PLpro induces inflammation in colonic epithelial cells and colonic inflammation in a mouse model, acting through the ISG15 signaling pathway. Using high-throughput screening, we identified two natural product-derived compounds, coptisine sulfate and (+)-shikonin, that inhibit the interaction between PLpro and ISG15 at the PLpro/ISG15 interface. We further investigated the mechanism of action of these two inhibitors using surface plasmon resonance, thermal shift assays, molecular docking, and molecular simulation studies. Importantly, both coptisine sulfate and (+)-shikonin were able to reduce intestinal inflammation in the PLpro-induced mouse model. These findings provide novel insights into how the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can drive inflammatory responses and introduce two natural compound-based inhibitors that may offer a new approach to alleviate gastrointestinal complications associated with COVID-19 infection. Our results highlight the potential of targeting the PLpro/ISG15 interaction as a therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",

Jun12682 and PF-07957472 are the first-in-class PL inhibitors showing potent in vivo antiviral efficacy in mouse models. In this study, we characterize naturally occurring mutations at residues located at the drug-binding site of Jun12682. The results reveal several PL mutants showing significant drug resistance while maintaining comparable enzymatic activity as the wild-type PL. The physiological relevance of the identified drug-resistant mutants, including E167G and Q269H, is validated through independent serial viral passage experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations and perturbative free energy calculations show that drug-resistant PL mutants weaken hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. Collectively, this study identifies E167, Y268, and Q269 as drug-resistant hotspots for PL inhibitors that bind to the BL2 loop and groove region, which are valuable in informing the design of the next-generation PL inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a highly transmissible and pathogenic RNA betacoronavirus. Developing small-molecule antiviral inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL  ) is advantageous due to the enzyme's role in processing viral polyproteins and disrupting host immune sensing. Given the structural and functional similarities between PL  and human deubiquitinases (DUBs), small-molecule inhibitors are frequently counter-screened for off-target activity using a panel of human DUBs. Through X-ray crystallography, DALI structural comparisons, and  analysis, a high-quality crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PL  enabled the identification of the closest structural human homologues of PL  . Among the 27 human DUBs identified, USP46 and USP12 displayed the greatest structural similarity to PL  , with alignment scores below 0.45 and RMSD values of 3.0 \u00c5 or less. Additionally, binding sites on ubiquitin-specific protease (USP46) and USP12, ancillary to the active site residues, share high sequence identity to the PL  substrate binding sites that are often engaged by the most potent PL  inhibitors. These findings offer a strong basis for choosing anti-targets and serve as a foundation for designing selective small-molecule PL  inhibitors.",

Although effective vaccination and antiviral therapeutics provide primary defense, SARS-CoV-2 remains a public health threat, given the emerging resistant variants. The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL) is essential for viral replication and is a promising drug target. We recently designed a series of biarylphenyl PL inhibitors with a representative lead  showing potent antiviral efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model. In this study, we designed a fluorescein-labeled biarylphenyl probe  and used it to optimize a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. The FP assay is suitable for high-throughput screening with a ' factor of 0.69. In addition, we found a positive correlation between the FP binding affinity and the enzymatic inhibitory potency of PL inhibitors, suggesting that the FP assay is valid in characterizing the binding affinity of PL inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are key enzymes in SARS-CoV-2 replication and serve as critical targets for an antiviral drug. Currently, Paxlovid\u00ae and Lagevrio\u2122 specifically target 3CLpro and RdRp, respectively, for COVID-19 treatment. However, no antivirals target for the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme, essential for viral replication and suppression of the host antiviral immune response. This study identified 9-aminominocycline (9-AMN) as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Unlike the parent compound minocycline, 9-AMN inhibits PLpro's proteolytic and deubiquitinase activities by approximately 90%, with IC values of 4.15\u00a0\u00b5M and 4.55\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively, while showing no effect on the enzymatic activity of 3CLpro or RdRp. Enzyme kinetics reveal that 9-AMN functions as a mixed PLpro inhibitor and binds to its active site, disrupting its function as predicted by computer modeling. Furthermore, 9-AMN demonstrates, efficacy against the Delta and Omicron variants, with EC values of 1.04\u00a0\u00b5M and 2.35\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. When combined with EIDD-1931 (an active form of molnupiravir) or nirmatrelvir (PF-332), 9-AMN exhibits synergistic effects, significantly reducing the doses required to inhibit the Omicron variant. In conclusion, 9-AMN inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and PLpro activity, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment strategies.",

This study presents the systematic design of quinoline-containing SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL) inhibitors as potential oral antiviral drug candidates. By leveraging the recently discovered Val70 binding site in PL, we designed a series of quinoline analogs demonstrating potent PL inhibition and antiviral activity. Notably, the X-ray crystal structures of 6 lead compounds reveal that the 2-aryl substitution can occupy either the Val70 site as expected or the BL2 groove in a flipped orientation. The in vivo lead Jun13296 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties and potent inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 variants and nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, oral treatment with Jun13296 significantly improves survival, reduces body weight loss and lung viral titers, and prevents lung tissue damage. These results underscore the potential of quinoline PL inhibitors as promising oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidates, instilling hope for the future of SARS-CoV-2 treatment.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has drastically reshaped global health and socioeconomic landscapes. The papain-like protease (PLpro) plays a critical role in viral polyprotein cleavage and immune evasion, making it a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Numerous compounds have been identified as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, with many characterized through crystallographic studies. To date, over 70 three-dimensional (3D) structures of PLpro complexed ligands have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, offering valuable insight into ligand-binding features that could aid the discovery and development of effective COVID-19 treatments targeting PLpro. In this study, we reviewed and analyzed these 3D structures, focusing on the key residues involved in ligand interactions. Our analysis revealed that most inhibitors bind to PLpro's substrate recognition sites S3/S4 and SUb2. While these sites are highly attractive and have been extensively explored, other potential binding regions, such as SUb1 and the Zn(II) domain, are less explored and may hold untapped potential for future COVID-19 drug discovery and development. Our structural analysis provides insights into the molecular features of PLpro that could accelerate the development of novel therapeutics targeting this essential viral enzyme.",

While Pfizer introduced , an FDA-approved antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), this study focuses on designing new antivirals against another protease, papain-like protease (PLpro), which is crucial for viral replication and immune suppression. NCATS/NIH performed a high-throughput screen of \u223c15,000 molecules from an internal molecular library, identifying initial hits with a 0.5% success rate. To improve the hit rate and identify potent inhibitors, machine learning-based virtual screens were applied to \u223c150,000 compounds, yielding 125 top predicted hits. Biochemical evaluation revealed 25 promising compounds, with a 20% hit-rate and IC values from 1.75 \u03bcM to <36 \u03bcM across 13 chemotypes. Further analog screening of those chemotypes, as part of the structure-activity relationships, led to 20 additional hits. Additionally, the hit-to-lead optimization of chemotype 7 produced 10 more analogs. These PLpro inhibitors provide promising templates for antiviral development against COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease PLpro has multiple roles in the viral replication cycle, related to both its polypeptide cleavage function and its ability to antagonize the host immune response. Targeting the PLpro function is recognized as a promising mechanism to modulate viral replication, while supporting host immune responses. However, the development of PLpro-specific inhibitors remains challenging. Comprehensive investigations utilizing enzymatic, binding studies, and cellular assays revealed the previously reported inhibitors to act in an unspecific manner. At present, GRL-0617 and its derivatives remain the best-validated compounds with demonstrated antiviral activity in cells and in mouse models. In this study, we refer to the pitfalls of the redox sensitivity of PLpro. Using a screening-based approach to identify inhibitors of PLpro's proteolytic activity, we made extensive efforts to validate active compounds over a range of conditions and readouts, emphasizing the need for comprehensive orthogonal data when profiling putative PLpro inhibitors. The remaining active compound, CPI-169, was shown to be a noncovalent inhibitor capable of competing with GRL-0617 in NMR-based experiments, suggesting that it occupied a similar binding site and inhibited viral replication in Vero-E6 cells, opening new design opportunities for further development as antiviral agents.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of new coronavirus variants and concerns about vaccine effectiveness against these novel variants emphasize the need for broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting conserved coronaviral non-structural proteins. Accordingly, a virtual library of 178 putative inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like protease (PL) was compiled through a systematic review of published literature and subsequently screened using molecular docking. Selected hits were analyzed for protease inhibitory activities, binding strength, and antiviral activities against HCoV229E-based surrogate system and subsequently against SARS-CoV-2 for validation. Differences in potential modes of action were investigated using an HCoV229E-based system, combined with in silico and biophysical methods against SARS-CoV-2 system. Of the 178 hits, 13 molecules showed superior docking scores against PL and met the inclusion criteria for further investigations. Of these, seven showed notable inhibitory activities against PL. Particularly, both Psoralidin and Corylifol-A exhibited superior and, importantly, dual activities against SARS-CoV-2 M. Both molecules were found to be biologically active against HCoV229E and SARS-CoV-2; however, Psoralidin exhibited more consistent effects and was relatively well-tolerated. Detailed in silico analyses of their interactions with the two proteases identified differences in their modes of action, primarily due to differences in their binding of PL. Based on these findings, we propose Psoralidin as a potential candidate for further development as a broad-spectrum antiviral and Corylifol-A as an ideal candidate for lead optimization.",

In this study, we made a striking discovery that Calcifediol demonstrates robust inhibitive effect on the of the papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro), a critical proteolytic enzyme for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-COV-2), through a small-scale FRET-based screening experiment. The practical bindings of Calcifediol to PLpro were also demonstrated by several in vitro interaction studies. All the evidence had revealed the inhibition might be caused by the targeted binding event. Consequently, our discovery represents a significant finding that the beneficial therapeutic impact of Calcifediol on COVID-19 may be attributed not only to its immunoregulatory properties but also to its inhibition of PLpro. This finding strongly bolsters the case for the clinical use of Vitamin D3 and its derivative Calcifediol in the treatment of COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3C-like protease (3CL), and papain-like protease (PL) are pivotal components in the viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, presenting as promising therapeutic targets. Currently, all FDA-approved antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are RdRp or 3CL inhibitors. However, the mutations causing drug resistance have been observed in RdRp and 3CL from SARS-CoV-2, which makes it necessary to develop antivirals with novel mechanisms. Through the application of a structure-based drug design (SBDD) approach, we discover a series of novel potent non-covalent PL inhibitors with remarkable in vitro potency and in vivo PK properties. The co-crystal structures of PL with lead compounds reveal that the residues D164 and Q269 around the S2 site are critical for improving the inhibitor's potency. The lead compound GZNL-P36 not only inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its variants at the cellular level with EC ranging from 58.2\u2009nM to 306.2\u2009nM, but also inhibits HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E with EC of 81.6\u2009nM and 2.66\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. Oral administration of the GZNL-P36 results in significantly improved survival and notable reductions in lung viral loads and lesions in SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, consistent with RNA-seq data analysis.

Due to the virus's reliance on PLpro for survival and propagation, small-molecule inhibitors of PLpro serve as an attractive model for direct-acting antiviral therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Building upon existing work aimed at designing covalent inhibitors against PLpro, we report the synthesis and structure-activity relationship of analogs based on the known covalent inhibitor 1 (Sanders, et al.2023). To evaluate the efficacy of synthesized derivatives, we conducted enzymatic inhibition assays, SARS-CoV-2/HeLa-ACE2 cellular potency and toxicity assays, and profiled the most promising analogs via in vitro ADME and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Additionally, we describe computational docking of profiled compounds bound to PLpro to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of compounds based on 1 and offer suggestions for optimizing the potency and selectivity of the electrophilic warhead and improving ADME and PK properties for this chemotype. Relative to the parent compound, new designs demonstrate comparable potency and target selectivity for PLpro. The accomplished SAR campaign provides novel insight for future development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a highly transmissible and pathogenic RNA betacoronavirus. Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve with or without drug selection pressure, and many variants have emerged since the beginning of the pandemic. The papain-like protease, PL, is a cysteine protease that cleaves viral polyproteins as well as ubiquitin and ISG15 modifications from host proteins. Leveraging our recently discovered Val70 binding site in PL, we designed covalent PL inhibitors by connecting cysteine reactive warheads to the biarylphenyl PL inhibitors via flexible linkers. Several leads displayed potent enzymatic inhibition (IC = 0.1-0.3 \u03bcM) and antiviral activity (EC = 0.09-0.96 \u03bcM). Fumaramide inhibitors , , and  showed favorable  pharmacokinetic properties with intraperitoneal injection. The X-ray crystal structure of PL with  validated our design strategy, revealing covalent conjugation between the catalytic Cys111 and the fumaramide warhead. The results suggest these covalent PL inhibitors are promising SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug candidates.",
