          "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a complex and highly heterogeneous malignancy marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which facilitates immune evasion and disease progression. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key immune checkpoint molecule expressed on tumor and immune cells, whose activation allows tumors to evade immune surveillance, plays a central role in modulating antitumor immunity in RCC. While the transcriptional and cytokine-mediated regulation of PD-L1 is well documented, emerging evidence emphasizes the critical influence of post-translational modifications particularly ubiquitination and deubiquitination in controlling PD-L1 stability and function. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), highlighting the roles of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs) in modulating PD-L1 expression and their broader implications in RCC tumor biology. We further discuss how these proteins influence immune cell infiltration, tumor progression, and response to immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of targeting UPS components, including proteasome inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimeras, is also explored. Understanding the UPS-mediated regulation of PD-L1 offers promising avenues for enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy in RCC.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases, is the most prevalent form. Treatment options for NSCLC include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapies. Among these, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have demonstrated significant potential, particularly in improving treatment outcomes. However, their clinical efficacy is impeded by challenges such as toxicity, resistance development, and variable patient responses. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut microbiome as an important modulator of immune responses in NSCLC, particularly in the context of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Specific gut microbes, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, have been associated with improved responses to immunotherapy, suggesting that modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance treatment outcomes. This review discusses the current understanding of the influence of gut microbiome on NSCLC and its potential to improve the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. By integrating microbiome-based insights into personalized treatment strategies, we can overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy approaches and optimize patient outcomes. This review aims to serve as a resource for the scientific community by providing insights into how modulation of gut microbiome may enhance treatment outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary liver malignancy, have historically been limited, particularly in unresectable cases with underlying cirrhosis. Initial systemic therapy with antiangiogenic agents, notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as sorafenib, showed modest survival gains but lacked durable responses. Subsequent trials with more potent VEGF pathway inhibitors failed to improve overall survival significantly, raising concerns about the long-term utility and potential hepatic and renal toxicities of prolonged VEGF blockade. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) marked a paradigm shift. Trial results demonstrating that dual-ICI regimens induced more durable responses and achieved higher long-term survival rates have challenged the prior VEGF-centric therapeutic approach and suggest that early use of dual ICIs may offer a more transformative effect on disease trajectory. Although anti-VEGF therapies remain valuable for initial tumor shrinkage, prolonged use may compromise liver regeneration and worsen portal hypertension. A refined treatment strategy emphasizing VEGF inhibition for a limited duration followed by or combined with ICIs may optimize both efficacy and safety. Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for ICI response and on developing regimens that maximize long-term survival in unresectable HCC.",

          "abstract": "Current response evaluation methods have accuracy limitations. Monitoring with a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation-based tumor fraction (TF) may provide a more accurate assessment of tumor burden across solid tumors. In this study, we evaluate a tissue-free, methylation-based TF and explore the association with treatment outcomes in RADIOHEAD, a cohort of 1,070 patients with solid tumors receiving standard of care (SoC) ICI regimens, with blood samples collected prospectively for retrospective analysis. 1,997 baseline and serial on-treatment plasma samples from 627 patients with stage IV cancer were analyzed with an analytically validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) methylation-based ctDNA assay (Guardant Reveal). The primary outcome measure was real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). Secondary outcomes included real-world overall survival (rwOS) and the lead time between non-molecular response (nMR) to rwPFS event. Patients with any decrease in TF while receiving ICI had superior outcomes. Patients with >80% decrease in TF at two timepoints or TF below the limit of quantification (LOQ) had longer rwPFS and rwOS than those with <80% decrease (nMR) (rwPFS HR 0.24 [95% CI 0.19, 0.32] p<0.005; rwOS HR 0.28 [95% CI 0.21, 0.38] p<0.005). nMR was detected prior to clinical progression in 209 patients with a median lead time of 3.03 months. Among 627 stage IV cancer patients receiving SoC ICI, monitoring with methylation-based TF identified patients who have significantly longer rwPFS and rwOS. Changes in TF on ICI can provide additional response data earlier than imaging alone and support the potential of serial monitoring to inform treatment decisions.",

This study evaluates the efficacy and mechanism of local radiotherapy combined with PD 1/PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic triple negative breast cancer treatment. A retrospective analysis of 40 patients divided into a combination group (local radiotherapy + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) and a single-agent group (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) was conducted. Clinical efficacy, progression-free survival, immune cytokine levels (Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-8), and adverse effects were compared. Results showed that the combination therapy significantly improved clinical outcomes and prolonged progression-free survival without increasing toxicity. Patients receiving local radiotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibited reduced immune cytokines, with no significant post-treatment increase in Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-8 levels. These findings suggest that local radiotherapy enhances the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in TNBC treatment without raising the risk of adverse effects.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), represented by atezolizumab and durvalumab, have shown encouraging therapeutic effects in the combination chemotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and have become preferred regimens. It has marked a seminal shift in the treatment landscape with achieving for the first time that overall survival exceed 1\u2009year. However, the extent to which SCLC patients can benefit from ICIs is limited, and ICIs' combination treatment strategies still need to be continuously explored. Beyond the ICIs in combination with radiotherapy, the anti-angiogenic target has been a combination option to improve effectiveness. And the novel formula of immune drugs, such as antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific T cell engager therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy, also promotes the potential option for SCLC patients. Based on the molecular development and biomarkers analysis of the sensitivity to immune checkpoint of the SCLC subtypes, the exploration of new targets and the development of drugs with novel mechanisms may provide fresh hope for immunotherapy in SCLC.",

Large, phase III registrational trials of ICI-containing regimens in resectable and embolization-eligible settings are now reading out. This review summarizes and critically appraises efficacy and safety data from these studies with consideration of the optimal use of ICIs in conjunction with antiangiogenic agents including important issues in management of HCC across the continuum of care such as those related to patient selection, treatment sequencing, and liver preservation. IMbrave050 assessed atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in resected HCC and EMERALD-1 and LEAP-012 evaluated addition of durvalumab-bevacizumab and pembrolizumab-lenvatinib to transarterial chemoembolization in unresectable, embolization-eligible HCC. Both EMERALD-1 and LEAP-012 met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. While IMbrave050 initially met its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival, the adjuvant atezolizumab-bevacizumab benefit was not maintained in an updated analysis. Survival benefits remain unclear for all phase III trials. Safety outcomes can be generally described as predictable based on experience with the respective experimental regimens in the advanced setting. Treatment selection in embolization-eligible settings should consider risks and benefits with special consideration of liver preservation. Additional research is required to optimize ICI combination use in the perioperative and peri-embolization settings.",

For  wild-type ATC and without other actionable alterations, the most promising strategy is certainly immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown activities both in monotherapy or in combination regimens. However, access to novel treatments is heterogeneous worldwide for ATC patients, and activity of immunotherapy as a single agent is limited. We report the case of a patient with locally advanced  wild-type ATC who achieved a near-complete and durable response following a multimodal treatment approach combining chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), and external beam radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was continued as maintenance therapy, and disease control was maintained for over 1 year. This case highlights the potential efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in  wild-type ATC, especially when a rapid tumor reduction is required. It supports the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with cytotoxic agents as a viable therapeutic option in this aggressive tumor subtype.",

          "abstract": "The most malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), has a high mortality rate. Recently, translational elements in GBM therapy have emerged as novel therapeutic strategies in addition to conventional treatment methods. In this way, Toll-like receptor (TLR), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NOTCH, and other signaling pathways have recently become some of the main signaling pathways in brain tumors. The immunological reactions to brain tumors are mediated by these mechanisms. A family of proteins known as TLRs is essential to the natural defense mechanism because it can identify and react to infections and other danger signals. TLRs have dual functions in the glioma microenvironment including that they can initially activate the innate and adaptive immune responses that support antitumor activity and secondly, their activation can also contribute to tumor progression by promoting inflammation and immune evasion, as they are expressed on both immune cells and tumor cells. TLR agonists are receiving more attention in the treatment of glioma because some of them have demonstrated survival benefits in clinical studies when used in conjunction with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The most exciting use of TLR agonists is that they can be used as immunomodulators to avoid dose accumulation, boost the efficiency of other therapies, and, by upregulating PD-1, reinforce delayed immune checkpoint resistance against PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. Therefore, the use of TLR agonists can lead to PD-L1 overexpression, which in turn enhances the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and triggers potent anticancer immune responses. In this article, we describe the function of the TLR signaling system, the cellular and molecular elements contributing to the etiology of glioblastoma multiforme, the connection between TLRs and glioma, and their significance for immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Pseudoprogression is an atypical response pattern to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), characterized by initial tumor enlargement or the appearance of new lesions, followed by subsequent tumor regression. While this phenomenon has been observed in several solid tumors, its occurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare and not well understood, presenting diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the first female case of HCC pseudoprogression during atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B-related advanced HCC. After multiple prior treatments, she was started on combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Following four treatment cycles, imaging revealed tumor enlargement and new small lesions, suggestive of disease progression. However, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level had decreased from 45,598 ng/mL to 23,719 ng/mL, and there was no clinical deterioration. Based on these findings, treatment was continued. Imaging after eight and 12 cycles demonstrated marked tumor regression and the normalization of AFP (<2 ng/mL), confirming a diagnosis of pseudoprogression. Although uncommon, pseudoprogression should be considered during ICI therapy for HCC. The accurate interpretation of radiologic findings in conjunction with clinical status and tumor markers is essential to avoid the premature discontinuation of potentially effective treatments. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, predictive markers, and clinical significance of pseudoprogression in HCC.",

Despite treatment with prednisolone, infliximab, and vedolizumab, the patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in hypoalbuminemia and unfeasibility of surgical intervention. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels served as a critical diagnostic clue, prompting abdominal radiography, which subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of toxic megacolon. This case highlights a rare but life-threatening complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors and underscores the challenges in managing refractory immune-related colitis. Given the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice, this report will be of significant interest to readers by emphasizing the importance of timely recognition, CRP monitoring, and intervention to prevent fatal outcomes in similar cases.",

          "abstract": "Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. The treatment landscape of gastrointestinal cancer has entered a new era with the advent of immunotherapy, which activates the immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells. Immunotherapy has demonstrated high efficacy and tolerable toxicity profiles compared to conventional therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 in combination with targeted therapy or chemotherapy have been approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors with good clinical patient benefit. In recent years, a variety of novel immunotherapeutic approaches have emerged. For example, adoptive T-cell therapy, such as claudin18.2-targeted CAR-T has achieved an objective remission rate of 48.6% in patients with advanced gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Oncolytic viruses inhibits tumor growth in both tumor lysis and immune activation, and is currently showing its efficacy against gastrointestinal tumors in some clinical trials. In addition, cancer vaccines, with their unique high degree of precision, have improved the effectiveness of individualized therapy. Personalized neoantigen vaccines combined with other immunotherapeutic drugs or chemotherapy, have shown some efficacy and safety in gastrointestinal patients. In this review, we summarize these recent advances in immunotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Additionally, the challenges and limitations linked to immunotherapy were explored. This review will expand our understanding of clinical studies on immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer and assist in individualizing patient treatment strategies, maximizing therapeutic benefits, and improving patient prognosis.",

          "abstract": "Liver metastasis is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Functional modulation of Kupffer cells (KCs) holds promise as an alternative immunotherapeutic approach. Leveraging their capacity to capture circulating virions, an oncolytic virus-based KC-targeting strategy is developed that demonstrated efficacy and safety in treating multifocal liver metastasis. A single intravenous infusion of the M51R mutant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-M51R), but not wild-type (WT) VSV, induced significant tumor regression in mouse models of forced liver metastasis, independent of direct oncolysis. The ineffectiveness of VSV-WT is attributed to its induction of massive KC apoptosis, whereas VSV-M51R replicated transiently within KCs without compromising viability. Instead, VSV-M51R promoted KC proliferation in tumor-adjacent areas, enhancing their access to tumor foci and cross-presentation of tumor antigens. This led to robust activation of hepatic anti-tumor CD8 T-cell responses, which required mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-dependent type I interferon triggering in KCs. Depletion of KCs abolished the T cell stimulating and anti-tumor effects of VSV-M51R. Furthermore, simultaneous blockade of programmed cell death-ligand 1(PD-L1) during VSV-M51R treatment achieved remarkable synergistic efficacy in treating monotherapy-resistant late-stage liver metastasis. These findings underscore the pivotal role of KCs in systemic oncolytic virotherapy and offer a potentially applicable strategy for treating advanced liver metastasis.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapy has demonstrated potential in treating various malignant tumors, but its efficacy in pancreatic cancer (PC) remains limited, possibly due to the dense stromal components and immunosuppressive microenvironment of PC. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular signaling pathways. However, the specific role of FAK in the development and progression of PC, as well as its regulatory mechanisms on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM), are still not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed single-cell sequencing datasets and clinical specimens to evaluate the role of FAK in the immune response of PC. We verified the impact of FAK alterations on CD8 T cell infiltration using a co-culture system of patient-derived organoids (PDO) and immune cells. Additionally, mouse PC models and dual humanized models are established to investigate the in vivo function of FAK and the potential of its inhibitors for immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that FAK is associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment in PC. Inhibiting FAK enhances CD8 T cell infiltration by promoting CXCL10\u00a0secretion in PC. Moreover, FAK inhibitors exhibit a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study explores the potential of FAK as a therapeutic target, particularly its role in modulating TIM, thereby providing new research directions for the treatment of PC.",

          "abstract": "Oncolytic immunotherapy, particularly using engineered adenoviruses, has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment due to its dual mechanism of action: selective tumor-cell destruction and inducing potent antitumor immune responses. This review focuses on the immunological effects observed in clinical trials involving conditionally replicating oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds), either with or without transgenes. These viruses primarily exert antitumor effects through mechanisms like direct oncolysis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy, while also activating innate and adaptive immune responses. Different genetic modification strategies have been employed to enhance the safety and therapeutic efficacy of OAds. However, these alterations may influence viral replication dynamics, oncolytic potency, and the duration of viral presence (i.e., persistence) within the tumor. Clinical data have shown that OAds can also profoundly alter the tumor microenvironment (TME), converting cold tumors to hot by increasing immune cell infiltration and activation. This conversion not only correlates with improved clinical outcomes but also creates conditions conducive to the efficacy of other immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which traditionally show limited activity in cold tumors. The synergistic potential of combining OAds with ICIs has shown promising results in improving clinical response rates. However, maximizing therapeutic benefit requires careful consideration of the OAd's immune-activating capabilities and optimal timing of combination strategies. This review provides critical insights into the current state of OAd-based immunotherapy, examining its role in modulating the TME, while addressing the complex interplay between oncolytic activity and sustained immune stimulation in clinical practice.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or durvalumab combined with chemotherapy show promise. However, those immune checkpoint inhibitors are very expensive. Tislelizumab may offer a more affordable alternative for advanced GBC. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report on the case of a 70-year-old patient with GBC who, after experiencing disease progression following standard second-line chemotherapy, was excluded from participating in a clinical trial due to poor performance status. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with stage IVB (TxN2M0) GBC. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with tislelizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine. OUTCOMES: The patient had a progression-free survival of 7 months and overall survival of 16 months. The overall overall survival from the onset of the disease was 23 months. LESSONS: The administration of tislelizumab improved survival in a patient with advanced gallbladder cancer. Tislelizumab emerged as a potential more cost-effective alternative option to pembrolizumab or durvalumab in our treatment strategy. These findings provide the basis for large-scale clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of tislelizumab for GBC.",

          "abstract": "RATIONALE: Penile metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an extremely rare clinical entity, particularly in the era of immune-checkpoint inhibitor and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor combination therapy. The mechanisms, clinical presentation, and optimal management of such cases remain poorly understood. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 75-year-old man with metastatic RCC undergoing systemic therapy developed persistent, painful erections (malignant priapism), along with urinary retention, general malaise, and back pain, 2 years after initiating treatment. DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the penis revealed a hypointense lesion on T2-weighted imaging and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging, suggestive of tumor infiltration into the corpus cavernosum. Blood gas analysis from corporal aspiration was consistent with nonischemic priapism. A diagnosis of penile metastasis from RCC was established. INTERVENTIONS: Embolization of the common penile artery was performed, followed by palliative radiotherapy (30 gray in 10 fractions). OUTCOMES: Despite these interventions, penile rigidity persisted, though partial symptomatic relief and pain reduction were achieved. Disease progression was noted, and the patient died approximately 3 months after the diagnosis of penile metastasis. LESSONS: This is the first reported case of penile metastasis from RCC during immune-checkpoint inhibitor-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy, highlighting a rare but clinically important metastatic pattern potentially unmasked by prolonged survival. Retrograde dissemination via Batson venous plexus may underlie this presentation. Radiotherapy and embolization may offer partial symptomatic relief, but the prognosis remains poor. Accumulation of further cases is necessary to guide future management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common head and neck cancer with low survival rates, especially in advanced stages, despite improved therapies. New developments show that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are promising treatment options. A better understanding of immune suppression in OSCC could enable new therapeutic approaches and effective ICI combinations.  The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the significance of the differential expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), CD28 and their ligands CD80 and CD86 for the diagnosis and treatment of OSCC. To this end, mRNA expression was analysed by RT-PCR and compared in 65 healthy oral mucosa samples (NOM) and 104 OSCC samples.  The expression of CTLA-4 (a soluble and membrane-bound isoform) was increased in OSCC by 1.72-fold ( = 0.004) and 6.88-fold ( < 0.001), respectively. There was no significant difference for CD28 ( = 0.283), nor for the soluble isoform of CD86 ( = 0.845). The membrane isoform of CD86 was increased in OSCC by a factor of 1.39 ( = 0.009) and CD80 by 6.11-fold ( < 0.001).  The results show a significant association between CTLA-4, CD80 and membrane-bound CD86 expression and diagnosis. They could improve diagnostics in multi-marker approaches and serve as therapeutic targets for ICI strategies. In particular, the data indicate a stronger immunosuppressive role of CD80 compared to CD86 in a tumor tissue context, suggesting the exploration of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CD80 antibody combinations in animal models.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alectinib is a widely used first-line ALK inhibitor for fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity, and its mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate how alectinib induces liver injury and to explore a potential protective strategy. METHODS: In vitro, AML-12\u00a0hepatocytes were incubated with alectinib to determine cell viability and morphology by using CCK-8 assay and optical microscopy, respectively. Necrosis was assessed by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Mitochondrial damage was analyzed by measuring membrane potential, ultrastructure, and respiratory chain complex activities using JC-1 staining under fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and assay kits, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using DCFH-DA staining and flow cytometry. Pyroptosis- and oxidative stress-related proteins (NLRP3, GSDMD-N, P20, cleaved IL-1\u03b2, Nrf2, HO-1) were quantified by Western blot. In vivo, C57BL/6J mice were divided into control, alectinib treatment, and alectinib plus magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) treatment groups. Serum ALT and AST were measured to assess liver function. Hepatic oxidative stress was evaluated by SOD and MDA levels. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by corresponding kits. Liver histopathology was examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: We found alectinib could induce the death of AML-12\u00a0hepatocytes. Alectinib impaired both the function and structure of mitochondria and caused a significant increase in ROS levels. The excessive accumulation of ROS triggered oxidative stress and finally resulted in cell pyroptosis in AML-12 cells. MgIG was found to alleviate mitochondrial damage and reduce ROS levels, restore the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress and pyroptosis caused by alectinib. CONCLUSION: Alectinib induces elevated ROS levels in hepatocytes by damaging mitochondria and causing oxidative stress in hepatocytes, which results in cell pyroptosis and ultimately hepatotoxicity, whereas MgIG can treat alectinib-induced hepatic injury by restoring mitochondrial function and structure.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms often appearing during childhood. Current approved long-term prophylaxis (LTP) for children aged <12 years require parenteral administration. Berotralstat is an oral, small-molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor, approved as prophylaxis of HAE attacks in patients aged \u226512 years. OBJECTIVE: APeX-P (NCT05453968), the largest trial of LTP in patients with HAE aged 2 to <12 years, evaluated oral berotralstat for the LTP of HAE in pediatric patients. METHODS: Before berotralstat initiation, patients received standard of care (SOC) for 12 weeks. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of berotralstat were assessed in a planned interim analysis. RESULTS: Median (range) age of patients (N=29) was 8.0 (3, 11) years, with 48.3% female. Median age at symptom onset was 2.0 years, and 82.8% of patients reported symptom onset before 6 years. Steady-state berotralstat median (range) Tmax was 3.9 hrs (0.9, 6.0) and geometric mean (coefficient of variation) Cmax was 204 ng/mL (40%) and AUC0-last was 915 ng\u2022hr/mL (42%). Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. There were no drug-related Grade 3/4 or serious AEs, deaths, or discontinuations related to AEs. Median (range) HAE attack rate during SOC was 0.96 (0, 5.0) attacks per 4-week period. Median (range) HAE attack rates for each 4-week period from Day 1 to Week 48 were 0 (Week 4: 0, 4.0; Week 48: 0, 1.7). CONCLUSION: Oral berotralstat was well tolerated and resulted in early and sustained reductions in HAE attack rates.",

          "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements have been identified as oncogenic drivers of multiple malignancies. Although at least three generations of ALK inhibitors have been developed, the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations remains a major barrier to drug efficacy. In this study, we develop a multiscale computational pipeline that combines hotspot residue identification, saturation mutagenesis screening, and alchemical free energy calculations to predict the impact of point mutations on the binding affinity of fourth-generation ALK inhibitors NVL-655 and TPX-0131. The hotspot residue analysis reveals that L1122, V1130, V1180, L1196, L1198, M1199, D1203, and L1256 contribute the most to ligand binding. A total of 9 and 13 mutations are identified as drug-resistant candidates with significantly decreased binding free energy of over 3\u202fkcal/mol for NVL-655 and TPX-0131, respectively. Specifically, V1180W, M1199W, and L1256S are the common mutations with decreased binding free energy concerning both inhibitors. These findings highlight important residues and mutations that may impact the clinical efficacy of NVL-655 and TPX-0131, and this pipeline provides an efficient and accurate framework to predict drug-resistant mutations and facilitate the rational design of next-generation ALK inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib, a third-generation Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), has demonstrated excellent curative effect in clinical studies to overcome mutations resistant to first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. It also has improved blood-brain barrier crossing and reduced brain metastases. METHODS: 44 patients were selected who received Lorlatinib as initial treatment for first-diagnosis ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or who received Lorlatinib as a back-line treatment after developing resistance with first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. The primary study endpoints are objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: For the 44 patients, the overall ORR[95% confidence intervals (CI)]was 59% (95% CI: 51-69), the DCR was 93% (95% CI: 36-56). In the first-line treatment group(n\u2009=\u200915), lorlatinib showned an ORR 93% (95% CI: 52-81), and the DCR was 100% (95% CI: 47-78). Additionally, 29 patients who received sequential Lorlatinib after progression on at least one first- or second-generation ALK-TKI showned an ORR of 41% (95% CI: 41-63) and a DCR of 90% (95% CI: 20-40). Lorlatinib demonstrated strong intracranial efficacay, with an overall intracranial objective response rate (IC-ORR) of 74% (95% CI: 67-92) and an intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) of 96% (95% CI: 53-81) in 23 patients with brain metastase. Among them, the IC-ORR and IC-DCR of 7 patients who received Lorlatinib as first-line therapy were both 100% (95% CI: 89-103). For 16 patients who had received at least one ALK-TKI, the IC-ORR with Lorlatinib was 63% (95% CI: 51-90), and the IC-DCR was 94% (95% CI: 27-70). 44 patients treated with Lorlatinib, all at a starting dose of 100\u00a0mg/day, 77% experienced adverse events, with the most common associated adverse event being hyperlipidaemia, However the overall grading was mild to moderate, with only one case of a reduction in dosage to 75\u00a0mg. CONCLUSIONS: This real-world evidence demonstrates that Lorlatinib exhibits significant clinical efficacy and intracranial anti-tumor activity in the treatment of ALK\u2009+\u2009NSCLC patients, whether in first-line or post-first-line treatment, while being well tolerated.",

          "abstract": "Protein hydrolysis-targeted chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional molecules designed for the selective degradation of target proteins. MS4078, a novel PROTAC, shows promise for treating ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet its clinical efficacy is hindered by suboptimal tumor targeting and off-target toxicities. To enhance its therapeutic profile, we developed human heavy chain ferritin (HFN) as a targeted delivery system, leading to the creation of HFN@MS4078 nanocages. Prepared via passive loading, HFN@MS4078 achieved a drug loading capacity of 178 molecules per nanocage with a HFN recovery rate of 70.1\u202f%. The nanocages exhibited a rapid release profile under lysosomal conditions (pH 5.0), with approximately 80\u202f% drug release after 60\u202fh, while maintaining over 80\u202f% stability at physiological pH 7.4. In vitro, HFN@MS4078 was actively internalized into lysosomes via TfR1 receptor binding, resulting in a 2.7-2.8 times reduction in IC values compared to free MS4078. Furthermore, HFN@MS4078 significantly decreased the expression levels of ALK, p-ALK, p-AKT, and p-ERK in NCI-H2228 and NCI-H3122 cell lines. In vivo, HFN@MS4078 substantially reduced tumor volume and prolonged survival while exhibiting negligible systemic toxicity. These results suggest that HFN@MS4078 represents a promising strategy for targeted therapy in ALK-positive NSCLC, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Brigatinib and alectinib are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) approved in China in 2022 and 2018, respectively, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive, advanced non\u2011small\u2011cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study is to conduct a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of first-line drugs, brigatinib and alectinib, in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states was used to simulate the health outcomes and costs of brigatinib and alectinib with a 30-year time horizon. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) data were used to obtain the comparative efficacy of brigatinib and alectinib, owing to lack of head-to-head trials. As the health benefits were comparable between brigatinib and alectinib on the basis of the ITCs, cost-minimization analysis (CMA) was conducted. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) were also conducted as scenario analyses using the different point estimates from the ITCs. Health state utilities and costs were obtained from public sources or clinical expert opinion. Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for the CMA. RESULTS: The CMA showed that, over 30\u00a0years, brigatinib (63,539 USD) was associated with cost savings of 14,203 USD compared with alectinib (77,742 USD). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that drug costs were the most influential parameter but brigatinib remained cost-saving in all the analyses. In the CEAs, the total cost of brigatinib was lower in all scenarios and also resulted in higher QALYs in 60% of the CEA scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Brigatinib was a cost-saving (14,203 USD) treatment compared with alectinib in the CMA analysis for the first-line treatment of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in China.",

          "abstract": "HexaBody-CD27 (GEN1053/BNT313) is an investigational novel agonistic CD27 antibody engineered to enhance T-cell costimulation and promote antitumor immunity. Through the introduction of a hexamerization-enhancing mutation in the IgG Fc domain, HexaBody-CD27 was designed to drive clustering and activation of CD27 via intermolecular Fc:Fc interactions between membrane-bound antibodies, independent of crosslinking by Fc\u03b3R-bearing cells. HexaBody-CD27 carries an Fc-silencing mutation to prevent T-cell depletion through Fc-mediated effector functions.\u00a0In vitro, HexaBody-CD27 induced CD27 receptor signaling independent of Fc\u03b3R-mediated crosslinking in a reporter assay. It also enhanced T-cell proliferation, cytotoxic activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in primary human lymphocytes. In contrast to benchmark IgG1 CD27 antibodies, HexaBody-CD27 did not induce phagocytosis of T cells in vitro. HexaBody-CD27 promoted ex vivo tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) expansion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, in particular of CD8 TILs. The combination of HexaBody-CD27 with an anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced T-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity in vitro compared to either compound alone. In conclusion, HexaBody-CD27 enhanced T-cell activation and effector functions in an Fc\u03b3R-crosslinking-independent manner, without inducing T-cell depletion. The immune agonist activity of HexaBody-CD27 was potentiated in combination with PD-1 blockade.",

          "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor of the RTK insulin superfamily, was named after its initial identification in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Following a reciprocal chromosomal translocation with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), ALK protein is abnormally expressed, promoting the malignant transformation of T cells into a more aggressive lymphoma. The inhibition of ALK activity could therefore benefit ALK+ ALCL patients. Despite the market availability and success of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), real-world ALK+ ALCL patients exhibit significant heterogeneity in terms of disease stage at first diagnosis, tumor progression, and responses to medication. This indicates a need for more detailed differentiation of ALK+ ALCL patients in clinical practice. Here, we discovered that apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-reduction/oxidation factor 1 (APE1/REF1), an interacting partner of NPM1, could stabilize NPM1-ALK fusion protein oligomers and enhance ALK tumor-promoting activity and growth, decreasing cell sensitivity to ALK-TKIs. Our results also reveal that disruption of the interaction weakens cell growth and augments the therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib and alectinib, ALK-TKIs, against ALK+ ALCL. Thus, high expression of APE1 indicates a faster growth of ALK+ ALCL; targeting this interaction may potentially achieve improved therapeutic outcomes, providing a reference for more precise treatment of ALK+ ALCL patients in clinical practice.",

We identified a rare case of ALK-positive histiocytosis with fusion of the ALK gene with TFG. A 35-year-old previously healthy male has been complaining of back and hip discomfort for seven months. A radiologic examination of the spine and pelvis revealed several hypermetabolic osteolytic lesions. Immunostaining for LCA, CD68, CD117and ALK were positive, whereas immunostaining for CD1a, Langerin, and S100 were negative. Analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed the fusion of the TFG and ALK genes. After receiving alectinib, an ALK inhibitor of the second generation, the patient showed a durable remission. ALK-positive histiocytosis is a distinct form of histiocytosis that has the potential to be treated with an ALK inhibitor.",

          "abstract": "In total, >90 unique anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement fusion partners have been identified, each with a unique sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, rendering targeted therapy challenging. In the present study, the efficacy of alectinib in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harbouring a novel ALK-microtubule-associated tumour suppressor candidate 2 (MTUS2) fusion and a rare Striatin 3 (STRN3)-ALK fusion was assessed. A 20-year-old non-smoker was hospitalised with a persistent cough. Subsequent positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed a tumour in the right lower lobe, with mediastinal, hilar, lymph node and bone metastases. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging also revealed a cerebral metastasis. Bronchoscopic biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe nodule, resulting in a clinical stage IVB diagnosis (cT2bN3bM1c). Targeted next-generation sequencing of tissue and blood samples revealed ALK-MTUS2 and STRN3-ALK fusions. The patient was treated with alectinib as the first-line therapy and a durable partial response was achieved after 3 months, with disappearance of the brain metastases. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first discovery of simultaneous ALK-MTUS2 and STRN3-ALK fusions. The clinical outcome offers potential therapeutic options for patients with rare ALK rearrangements and underscores the necessity for further research on the functions of these fusions.",

In pediatric patients, the majority of cases are Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-positive. Despite intensive multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, treatment failure rates remain at 25-30%. Recent advancements in targeted therapies, notably ALK inhibitors and the anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin, have demonstrated substantial activity in relapsed and refractory settings. Molecular detection of minimal disseminated disease (MDD) and minimal residual disease (MRD) offer improved prognostic stratification. For patients with relapsed or refractory disease, targeted therapies have increased treatment options, but more work needs to be done to define optimal treatment regimens, duration, and need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in this group. Immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy provide additional therapeutic options. Incorporating targeted therapies and MDD/MRD assessments into clinical trials could significantly improve outcomes for pediatric and adolescent patients with ALCL.",

These attacks may involve immune and inflammatory mechanisms. We compared serum biomarkers indicating vascular integrity, leakage, angiogenesis, coagulation, and inflammation. During an attack-free period, we assessed 34 markers simultaneously using multi- and/or singleplex ELISA in 25 patients with C1-INH-HAE, 17 with ACEi-AE, 25 with Hist-AE, and 23 healthy controls. Differential blood counts, C1-INH-HAE-specific laboratory parameters, and recently developed assays addressing early complement and lectin pathways were included. The results revealed significant differences, as well as some similarities. Tie-2, VEGFs, C1s/C1INHc appear to play a role in all AE types regardless of whether they are bradykinin- or histamine-mediated. Furthermore, evidence was found for a role of IL-17, eosinophil, and neutrophil chemotactic factors, and the activation of these granulocytes was found. MASP-1/C1-INHc indicated early activation of the lectin pathway in ACEi-AE and HistAE, but not in C1-INH-HAE. C1s/C1-INHc and MASP-1/C1INHc ratio was able to discriminate C1-INH-HAE from controls and the other AE types. Future investigations in C1-INH-HAE, ACEi-AE, and Hist-AE should not only focus on complement activation but also the interaction with granulocytes.",

          "abstract": "The study investigated the potential of nano-formulated orientin (NF-O) in the anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. Orientin is a flavonoid that has a promising effect against anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-arrhythmia properties. Nano-formulation aimed to overcome this limitation and also served to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. In silico docking studies, the favorable binding of orientin was identified with the key oncogenic targets (EGFR, ALK, KRAS, NTRK). After nano-formulation, UV spectroscopy confirmed the integrity of orientin with no shift in the \u03bbmax (347\u2009nm). Dynamic light scattering showed a significant reduction in the improved particle size (PDI decreased from 0.863 to 0.173) by nano-formulation from 559\u2009nm to 220\u2009nm. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the nano-formulation process did not alter the chemical structure of orientin. In-vitro studies using MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that NF-O inhibited cell growth and reduced viability in a dose-dependent manner. At 10 \u00b5M, NF-O significantly inhibited the cell growth and migration compared to the control and native orientin in wound healing assays (p\u2009<\u20090.01). In ova, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, NF-O (10 \u00b5g/ml) significantly inhibited angiogenesis by reducing blood vessel density, branching, length, and network formation compared to controls and native orientin. These findings suggest that NF-O holds significant promise as a novel anti-angiogenic agent for the cancer treatment.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK-rearrangement. Ceritinib, a clinically approved ALK inhibitor, is associated with some adverse reactions, including organizing pneumonia (OP). However, few cases of ceritinib-induced OP have been reported to date. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old female patient with ALK\u2009+\u2009lung adenocarcinoma presented with paroxysmal cough lasting 3\u00a0months. Antibiotic therapy was not effective, and blood and sputum cultures were negative. DIAGNOSIS: A computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the left upper lung was performed and hematoxylin-eosin staining was consistent with OP. The diagnosis of ceritinib-induced OP was considered based on these results. INTERVENTIONS: Ceritinib was then stopped, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone (40\u00a0mg ivgtt qd) for one week. The dose was lowered to 32\u00a0mg po qd with regular follow-up. Later, the patient switched to another ALK inhibitor, ensartinib, for treatment, and the steroid was discontinued after two months. OUTCOMES: A Chest CT scan after one week of treatment showed progressive disappearance of lung lesions, and the patient was discharged on oral methylprednisolone (32\u00a0mg qd) for two weeks after which the dose was reduced gradually. CONCLUSION: OP should be considered when new lesions appear in the lungs of lung cancer patients, and distinguished from infectious pneumonia, metastasis, or cancer progression. In this respect, pathological biopsy plays an important role in diagnosis. In our case, discontinuation of ceritinib and regular steroid administration were effective.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ALK inhibitors for ALK fusion-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), drug resistance remains a challenge. Studies of treatment outcomes and resistance biomarkers are imperative for drug development, yet patient representation can be limited. This study evaluated the feasibility of a decentralized research infrastructure to establish a clinical and biospecimen repository, broadening patient access and inclusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC across the U.S. were enrolled through remote informed consent. Clinical history and tumor molecular profiling data were collected at baseline and during remote follow-ups. Archival tumor and saliva biospecimens (for germline sampling) were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: Of 87 eligible patients, 80 (92%) completed remote consent and enrolled. Clinical data collection rate was 100%, with archival tumor acquired from 80% and saliva samples from 65%. Patients represented 31 states, with 94% residing outside the study center's state and 90% receiving care elsewhere. Next-generation sequencing was conducted on 55 treatment-na\u00efve and 18 treatment-resistant biopsies, all of whom received at least one prior second-generation ALK inhibitor and nine received lorlatinib. ALK resistance mutations were identified in 54% of treatment-resistant biopsies; other commonly co-altered genes included TP53 (18%) and CDKN2A/B (16%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the feasibility of a decentralized design to enhance the inclusion of a broader patient population with ALK+ NSCLC. This establishes a scalable framework that may help overcome barriers to patient participation in research, with the goal of improving therapy development and patient outcomes. The ENIGMA+ study accrual and analysis continue (NCT04881916).",

          "title": "Utility of serum CYFRA 21-1 as a prognostic biomarker in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer treated with ALK-TKIs: a retrospective cohort study.",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 3-7% of all cases and causes oncogene addiction. Although ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) are effective for treating ALK-positive NSCLC, some patients still show suboptimal responses and poor outcomes. Clinically simple and detectable biomarkers for this group are limited. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1 and CYFRA) are widely used tumor markers in NSCLC. Elevated CEA levels are linked to tumor progression and resistance to cell death, while CYFRA is widely expressed in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. CYFRA has been identified as a prognostic factor in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive NSCLC, but its role in ALK-positive NSCLC remains unclear. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed the value of CEA and CYFRA as predictive biomarkers in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC treated with ALK-TKIs. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 197 patients with advanced or recurrent ALK-positive NSCLC, who were diagnosed across 13 institutions in Japan and received their first ALK-TKI between July 1, 2014 and December 31, 2022. Eligible patients had measurable lesions based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Patients were stratified based on normal (\u22645.0 and \u22643.5 ng/mL) or high (>5.0 and >3.5 ng/mL) baseline serum CEA and CYFRA levels. Serum CYFRA and CEA levels, which were measured using commercially available immunoassays per standard institutional protocols. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) with initial ALK-TKI therapy, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 152 patients with available CYFRA data, 91 (59.9%) had normal CYFRA levels and 61 (40.1%) had elevated levels. In this analysis, patients in the high CYFRA group had significantly shorter median PFS and OS (9.27 and 28.8 months, respectively) than those in the normal CYFRA group (42.0 and 143.3 months, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high CYFRA levels were independent predictors of poor PFS (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.50-3.68, P<0.001) and OS (HR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.89-5.70, P<0.001). Furthermore, the high CYFRA group had lower ORR and complete response (CR) rates, compared with the normal CYFRA group. In contrast, no significant differences in PFS or OS were observed between patients with normal and elevated CEA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CYFRA levels correlate with reduced PFS and OS in ALK-positive NSCLC, indicating potential as a prognostic biomarker. Given CYFRA's association with tumor heterogeneity, which reduces ALK-TKI efficacy, its assessment could aid in risk stratification and treatment planning. Additional research is needed to verify the predictive value of CYFRA for ALK-TKI efficacy.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant anaplastic lymphoma kinase () rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an unmet need. Among these patients, the efficacy of immunotherapy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with ALK-TKI-resistant NSCLC, stratified by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of advanced NSCLC patients with -rearrangement, who were treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy after the development of ALK-TKI resistance at the Shanghai Chest Hospital. Progression-free survival (PFS) was used to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: The final analysis included 89 patients between June 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, who met the selection criteria. The entire cohort had a median follow-up time of 33.4 months. The patients who received immunotherapy had better PFS than those who received non-immunotherapy (median PFS: 5.3  2.5 months; P=0.009). The PD-L1-positive patients who received immunotherapy had a median PFS of 7.1 months, while those who received non-immunotherapy had a median PFS of 2.5 months (P=0.02). No such statistically significant difference was observed in the PD-L1-negative patients (median PFS for with immunotherapy  without immunotherapy: 1.5  2.9 months; P=0.68). The PD-L1-positive patients who underwent re-biopsy after the development of TKI resistance and who received immunotherapy had a PFS of 7.8 months, while those who received non-immunotherapy had a PFS of 2.7 months (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first real-world retrospective study to show that some patients with positive PD-L1 expression may benefit from immune-based therapy after the development of ALK-TKI resistance. However, we still recommend biopsy for patients who develop ALK-TKI resistance to provide further treatment guidance.",

          "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies, with poor drug response and high mortality rates. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy, leveraging E3 ligases to degrade oncogenic proteins selectively via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These degraders offer higher selectivity and bioavailability compared to traditional inhibitors. This review explores how PROTACs eliminate oncogenic proteins in lung cancer and examines the role of E3 ligases in this process. Commonly utilized ligases include Cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), while newer ones, such as MDM2 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), are being investigated for therapeutic potential. We discuss key factors in PROTAC design, including ligand selection, linker optimization, and pharmacokinetic properties, which influence tumor specificity and efficacy while minimizing off- target effects. Additionally, we highlight targetable oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, such as KRAS, EGFR, and ALK fusion proteins, and evaluate preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate PROTACs' potential for overcoming drug resistance. The challenges associated with clinical translation, tumor microenvironment interactions, and E3 ligase selection are also discussed. Finally, we present future perspectives, including expanding the range of E3 ligases, developing multitargeting strategies, and integrating next-generation molecular glue degraders. By offering a comparative analysis of E3 ligase- specific PROTACs, this review underscores the potential of PROTAC technology to advance precision oncology in lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are the standard first-line treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. However, their clinical success is limited by the eventual development of acquired resistance in patients mainly induced by EGFR mutations and the activation of alternative signaling pathways (e.g., c-Met). Herein, we reported a \"one stone, two birds\" strategy to combat the drug resistance of NSCLC to EGFR-TKIs by constructing a cyclized bivalent aptamer-based proteolysis-targeting chimera, or PROTAC, termed AHPC-cb-Ap, which efficiently degraded c-Met and its interacting multiple tyrosine kinases, including EGFR. By simultaneously degrading c-Met and EGFR, AHPC-cb-Ap could restore the sensitivity of erlotinib-resistant NCI-H1975 cells (EGFR) to erlotinib, both  and . In a preclinical NCI-H1975 tumor model pretreated with AHPC-cb-Ap, erlotinib achieved approximately 70% antitumor efficacy, comparable to that of the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib. Taken together, our strategy of simultaneously degrading c-Met and EGFR, which underlie resistance to EGFR-TKIs, provides a comprehensive approach to combat the drug resistance of NSCLC.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. METHODS: 42 IgA nephropathy patients treated with finerenone combined with renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASI) and 42 patients who received RASI monotherapy were included in this study. The follow-up duration was 3 months. The efficacy and safety of finerenone were assessed based on key parameters, including urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, serum albumin, hematuria, and serum potassium at 1 and 3 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that finerenone combined with RASI significantly reduced proteinuria in IgA nephropathy patients. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant time * treatment interaction ( = 0.032), and subsequent one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a marked decline in log-transformed UPCR over time in the combination group (P < 0.001) but not in the monotherapy group (P = 0.187). Correspondingly, the combination group achieved a 27.29% reduction in UPCR at one month (95% CI: 13.47-39.68%, P = 0.017) and a 34.17% reduction at three months (95% CI: 21.84-52.75%, P < 0.001) compared to baseline, whereas RASI monotherapy failed to show any significant proteinuria-reduction effects. Notably, the antiproteinuric effect was consistent across subgroups. Serum potassium and creatinine levels remained stable, and no adverse events related to hyperkalemia were observed. CONCLUSION: The retrospective evaluation suggests that finerenone combined with RASI effectively reduced proteinuria in IgA nephropathy patients, underscoring its potential as a viable treatment option for this patient population.",

          "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor () mutations occur in approximately 10-20% of Caucasian and up to 50% of Asian patients with oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most frequently, alterations include exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations, which confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In the last decade, the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib has represented the first-line standard of care for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, the development of acquired mechanisms of resistance significantly impacts long-term outcomes and represents a major therapeutic challenge. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition () gene amplification and MET protein overexpression have emerged as prominent EGFR-independent (off-target) resistance mechanisms, detected in approximately 25% of osimertinib-resistant NSCLC. Noteworthy, variability in diagnostic thresholds, which differ between fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, complicates its interpretation and clinical applicability. To address MET-driven resistance, several therapeutic strategies have been explored, including MET-TKIs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and dual EGFR/MET inhibition has emerged as the most promising strategy. In this context, the bispecific EGFR/MET antibody amivantamab has demonstrated encouraging efficacy, regardless of MET alterations. Furthermore, the combination of the ADC telisotuzumab vedotin and osimertinib has been associated with activity in EGFR-mutant, c-MET protein-overexpressing, osimertinib-resistant NSCLC. Of note, several novel agents and combinations are currently under clinical development. The success of these targeted approaches relies on tissue re-biopsy at progression and accurate molecular profiling. Yet, tumor heterogeneity and procedural limitations may challenge the feasibility of re-biopsy, making biomarker-agnostic strategies viable alternatives.",

This study aimed to establish patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) using small biopsy samples and surgical specimens to create a model system that preserves the genetic and histological features of the original tumors.  PDTOs were generated from 163 lung cancer specimens, including 109 samples obtained using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or bronchoscopy, 52 surgical specimens, and 2 pleural fluid samples. The organoid establishment rate beyond passage three was assessed, and histological subtypes and genetic profiles were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining and targeted exome sequencing.  The overall PDTO establishment rate was 34.4% (56/163), and 44.6% (25/56) of these organoids retained the histological and genetic features of the parental tumors. Genetic analysis identified key mutations, including KRAS G12C, EGFR L858R, MET exon 14 skipping mutation, and ROS1 fusion. PDTOs successfully formed tumors in mice while maintaining the genetic characteristics of the original tumors. Co-culture of PDTOs with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) resulted in increased resistance to paclitaxel. In the co-culture model of PDTOs with immune cells, dose-dependent growth inhibition of PDTOs was observed in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  PDTOs established from small biopsy and surgical specimens serve as a valuable model for studying lung cancer biology, tumor microenvironment interactions, and drug response. This model has the potential to improve personalized treatment strategies.",

Recent evidence demonstrates several roles of FTO in tumorigenesis. In this study, we seek to explore the role of FTO in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenicity and its relationship with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase resistance. : We performed qPCR, immunoblotting, viability assays, migration assays, and ATP assays to investigate the functions of FTO in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, specifically to erlotinib, in three NSCLC cell lines harboring either wild-type or mutant EGFR. We also performed immunohistochemistry on lung tumor tissues from patients diagnosed at different stages of NSCLC. : Our study found an upregulation of FTO in erlotinib-resistant (ER) cell lines at both the gene and protein levels. FTO inhibition and knockdown significantly reduced cell viability of erlotinib-resistant H2170 and PC9 cells by over 30% when treated with 0.8 \u00b5M of Dac51 and about 20% when treated with siFTO. FTO inhibition also slowed down the migration of ER cells, and the effect was even more pronounced when combined with erlotinib. Furthermore, FTO was found to be overexpressed in late-stage NSCLC tumor tissues compared to early-stage tumors, and it was upregulated in patients who smoked. : These findings suggest FTO might mediate resistance and tumor growth by augmenting cell proliferation. In addition, FTO can be a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC patients.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown marked efficacy for HER2 mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The intracellular trafficking of mutant HER2 has remained to be fully elucidated, however. METHODS: HER2 dynamics were examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant HER2 with the use of live cell imaging and an in situ proximity ligation assay. Proteins related to mutant HER2 trafficking were identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: HER2 internalization was enhanced in NSCLC cells expressing mutant HER2 compared with those expressing HER2(WT). Homodimers of HER2(WT) were localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas those of mutant HER2 were present mostly in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of EGFR or HER3 suppressed internalization of HER2(WT) but not that of mutant HER2. The enhanced internalization of mutant HER2 was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as was reflected by increased binding of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to mutant HER2 and its consequent ubiquitination, and was attenuated by treatment with zongertinib, a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of HER2 phosphorylation promotes internalization of mutant HER2 mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, likely contributing to the efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs in NSCLC positive for HER2 mutations.",

Deep learning approaches are becoming cost-effective alternatives to high-throughput experimental methods for ligand identification. Here, to predict the binding affinity between proteins and small molecules, we introduce Ligand-Transformer, a deep learning method based on the transformer architecture. Ligand-Transformer implements a sequence-based approach, where the inputs are the amino acid sequence of the target protein and the topology of the\u00a0small molecule to enable the prediction of the conformational space explored by the complex between the two. We apply Ligand-Transformer to screen and validate experimentally inhibitors targeting the mutant EGFR kinase, identifying compounds with low nanomolar potency. We then use this approach to predict the conformational population shifts induced by known ABL kinase inhibitors, showing that sequence-based predictions enable the characterisation of the population shift upon binding. Overall, our results illustrate the potential of Ligand-Transformer to accurately predict the interactions of small molecules with proteins, including the binding affinity and the changes in the free energy landscapes upon binding,\u00a0thus uncovering molecular mechanisms and facilitating the initial steps in drug design.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The benefits and risks of complement inhibitors for the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) remain uncertain. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of complement inhibitors vs. placebo. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched until December 20, 2024. This study analyzed the effects of complement inhibitors on the 24-h urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (24-h UPCR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the incidence of adverse events in IgAN. RESULTS: In total, 4 studies with 398 patients were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. In patients with IgAN, complement inhibitors significantly attenuated the decline in eGFR [MD\u2009=\u20093.50\u00a0ml/min/1.73 m, 95% CI (0.44, 6.57),\u00a0P\u2009<\u20090.05] and demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing proteinuria markers: a 24-h UPCR reduction of -0.71\u00a0g/g [95% CI (-0.91, -0.50),\u00a0P\u2009<\u20090.05] was observed. Safety analyses revealed comparable tolerability between the intervention and control groups, with no statistically significant difference in adverse event incidence [RR\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI (0.74, 1.11),\u00a0P\u2009=\u20090.35]. CONCLUSION: Complement inhibitors appear to confer renal protective effects without increasing the risk of adverse events in patients with IgAN.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations, including amplifications, mutations, and fusions, are prevalent in GBM and represent potential therapeutic targets. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has demonstrated efficacy in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer and central nervous system metastases. However, its efficacy in GBM remains uncertain. We present 2 cases of recurrent GBM harboring distinct EGFR alterations treated with osimertinib. Both patients, despite showing EGFR amplification or activating mutations (G719D), experienced rapid disease progression and clinical deterioration during treatment. These findings highlight the resistance of GBM to osimertinib, possibly due to tumor heterogeneity, subclonal variation, or intrinsic mechanisms linked to EGFR amplification and redundant oncogenic pathways. Our observations align with prior trials of EGFR-TKIs in GBM, which have shown limited benefit. These cases underscore the complexity of targeting EGFR in GBM and the need for advanced therapeutic approaches, including next-generation EGFR inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, to overcome resistance. Further studies are crucial to optimize EGFR-targeted therapies in GBM.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review investigates the complex association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and lung cancer, focusing on shared risk factors, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications. We aim to quantify the impact of T2DM on lung cancer incidence, progression, and treatment response, and evaluate the role of glycemic control and antidiabetic therapies. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted following a targeted search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for published studies. Search terms included \"type 2 diabetes mellitus,\" \"lung cancer,\" \"non-small cell lung cancer,\" \"hyperglycemia,\" \"insulin resistance,\" and relevant synonyms. Inclusion criteria were original research articles, meta-analyses, and clinical trials involving human subjects that explored epidemiological associations, molecular mechanisms, pharmacologic interventions, or prognostic implications of T2DM in lung cancer. Studies focusing solely on type 1 diabetes, animal models, or non-English language were excluded. Key findings were synthesized to provide mechanistic insights and clinical relevance. RESULTS: Epidemiological evidence indicates a 20-48% increased relative risk of lung cancer in individuals with T2DM, with incidence rates reaching 125 per 100,000 in diabetics versus 85 per 100,000 in non-diabetics. Shared risk factors include obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. Molecular pathways such as K-Ras and PI3K/Akt activation, IGF-1R overexpression, and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. Metformin is associated with reduced lung cancer incidence and improved progression-free survival (58% vs. 37% at 2 years). Pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors show potential benefits, though clinical evidence remains mixed. CONCLUSION: T2DM significantly influences lung cancer biology and prognosis. Integrating glycemic control with cancer therapy-particularly metformin and EGFR-TKI combinations-offers promising avenues for improving outcomes. Future research should focus on biomarker-driven stratification and targeted therapeutic strategies tailored to diabetic lung cancer patients.",

          "abstract": "Penile carcinoma is a rare malignancy, predominantly derived from squamous epithelium, with a partially aggressive clinical course. The 2022 WHO classification distinguishes HPV-associated (HPV(+)) and HPV-independent (HPV(-)) subtypes, a differentiation that bears significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. HPV(-) carcinomas often develop as result of chronic inflammation, e.g. lichen sclerosus. While HPV(+) tumours, such as the warty subtype, often exhibit an indolent course, basaloid and sarcomatoid variants are associated with poor prognosis and an increased risk of metastasis.The prognostic value of HPV status alone is still inconsistent across studies. In contrast, p16 overexpression as surrogate marker for HPV infection, has been linked to improved survival outcomes. A combined assessment of HPV and p16 status is therefore recommended, particularly for therapeutic decision-making. In HPV(-) tumours, additional analysis of p53 expression is advisable, as TP53 mutations - frequently observed in this group - are associated with more aggressive tumour biology.Beyond conventional platinum-based chemotherapy, targeted therapies are gaining attention. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as enfortumab vedotin (targeting Nectin-4) and sacituzumab govitecan (targeting Trop-2) have shown promising efficacy in other tumour types. Both targets are also expressed in penile carcinoma, and early clinical trials are underway. HER2 is expressed in a relevant proportion of cases and may be an additional therapeutic target.Immune checkpoint inhibitors like atezolizumab have so far demonstrated limited efficacy in penile cancer, despite high rates of PD-L1 expression. This discrepancy may be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies are also a potential treatment option.Accurate histopathological and molecular characterisation is critical for personalised treatment approaches and should become an integral component of the clinical management of penile carcinoma.",

          "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane-bound protein that interacts with epidermal growth factor, triggering receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation, subsequently promoting cell proliferation. EGFR-associated pathways regulate cell housekeeping functions like growth, division, and apoptosis. However, the mutations/overexpression of EGFR cause unrestrained cell differentiation, leading to tumorigenesis. This study proposes a machine-learning-based tool, EGFR, to compute novel molecules' biological activities (pIC) against EGFR. The tool is based on a robust quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model, trained on a large dataset of existing EGFR inhibitors using multiple machine learning algorithms. The extra trees regressor (ET) model showed promising results for the training dataset with an   value of 0.99, an RMSE value of 0.07 and an MAE of 0.009. The Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted pIC values of the training set inhibitors was also very substantial,  0.99. The model was then validated using a test dataset, and the findings were satisfactory. An   value of 0.67, an RMSE of 0.89 and an MAE of 0.61 were detected for the test dataset, and the Pearson correlation coefficient of observed/predicted pIC values was 0.82. The model was probed for overfitting using 10-fold cross-validation, and a series of structure-based drug design experiments were performed to validate the tool's predictions. The findings backed up the model's performance. This tool will be of significant importance to medicinal chemists in identifying promising EGFR inhibitors.",

METHODS: The retrospective study enrolled 140 patients between May 2017 and December 2022 from Center 1, and 45 patients between January 2015 and March 2024 from Center 2. All patients underwent an F-FDG PET/CT scan. Patients with BM underwent brain MRI. Radiomics features were extracted from both primary lesion and BM and selected using max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) method. A logistic regression model was developed based on primary lesion and BM, and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the applicability. RESULTS: A total of 7 and 5 important features were selected from primary lesion and BM, respectively. The SUVmax was identified as the most predictive clinical indicator. The developed nomogram based on primary lesion generated AUCs of 0.832, 0.775 and 0.798 in training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram based on BM yielded AUCs of 0.985, 0.921 and 0.956 in training, internal validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that radiomics features from PET/CT and MRI of primary lesion and BM can be predictive of response to EGFR-TKI. The constructed nomogram may be considered as a non-invasive tool to stratify which patient can benefit from the EGFR-TKI therapy.",

METHODS: Consecutive eligible patients were prospectively enrolled in 16-centers in China. The primary endpoints were second-line (2\u2009L) treatment patterns and clinical outcomes, including median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) from 2\u2009L treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 300 patients were enrolled in the study, and among them, 291 patients were included in the Full Analysis Set, and 213(73.2%) underwent molecular testing, after progression from 1\u2009L therapy. 30.5% (65/213) had tissue samples, while 66.7% (142/213) had plasma samples. In tissue and plasma samples, T790M positive rates were 53.8% and 43.7%, respectively. mPFS and mOS for patients with T790M positive who received third generation (3\u2009G) EGFR-TKIs as 2\u2009L therapy were 14.7\u2009months and 32.0\u2009months, respectively. The mPFS for patients with T790M negative who received 3\u2009G EGFR-TKIs, prior EGFR-TKIs plus local therapy, and chemotherapy as 2\u2009L therapy were 7.6\u2009months, 10.2\u2009months, and 4.9\u2009months, respectively. The corresponding mOS for these patients were 21.2\u2009months, 16.6\u2009months, and 15.0\u2009months, respectively. No new safety signal emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acquired resistance to first generation (1\u2009G)/second generation (2\u2009G) EGFR-TKIs receiving 3\u2009G EGFR-TKIs, especially T790M positive, showed better clinical outcomes after molecular testing.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. METHODS: We conducted comparative transcriptomic profiling via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of lung tissues from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Additionally, we assessed the effects of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) interventions on mRNA and protein expression profiles in SHR pulmonary tissue using integrated omics approaches. RESULTS: Core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in SHR versus WKY comparisons included Nuf2 and Cenpa, with significant enrichment in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In SHR versus ARB-treated cohorts, hub genes Ccnb2 and Mad2l1 demonstrated primary pathway enrichment in cell cycle regulation and human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. ARNI intervention yielded distinct hub genes (Gzma, Icam1) enriched in PI3K/AKT signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions. Proteomic analysis confirmed concordant expression patterns for EGFR and JUN proteins with transcriptomic findings. CONCLUSION: ARB and ARNI therapies mitigate hypertension-induced pulmonary damage through divergent molecular mechanisms, with PI3K/AKT signaling and ECM-receptor interactions serving as central regulatory hubs in this protective process.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2i depends on baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but whether the same is true for the blood pressure lowering effect is unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed (Study 1) and analysed data from a clinical study (Study 2) to investigate if the blood pressure lowering effect of SGLT2i depends on baseline eGFR. In the literature review, we performed a weighted regression analysis with mean change in SBP and DBP as dependent variables and mean eGFR as an independent variable. Furthermore, we analyzed data from a cohort of 48 patients with either type 2 diabtes mellitus with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) or non-diabetic CKD with varying degrees of kidney function. RESULTS: 2069 articles were identified of which 27 articles met the inclusion criteria. Analysis revealed a mean weighted reduction in SBP -4.7 mmHg compared to baseline and -3.5 mmHg compared to placebo. The weighted regression analysis showed no correlation between change in SBP and baseline eGFR. Data analysis of 48 patients revealed a SBP reduction of 5.5 mmHg and the simple linear regression revealed no correlation between the decrease in blood pressure and baseline eGFR.

However, there is an unmet medical need for patients with perianogenital cSCC or cSCC refractory to PD-1 therapy.

The primary endpoint was objective response (OR). Predefined subgroups were line of therapy and localisation of the primary tumor (perianogenital/other locations). RESULTS: Of 52 enrolled patients, 49 received at least 1 dose of treatment. Of these, 20 patients achieved an OR (41%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 27-56, 9 partial/11 complete responses (PRs/CRs)). While treatment-na\u00efve patients (n=35) achieved a higher OR rate (46%, 95% CI 29-63) than those pretreated (29%, 95% CI 8-58), 4/14 pretreated patients experienced an OR, 2 with prior PD-1 inhibition. 5 out of 14 patients with perianogenital cSCC achieved an OR (36%, 95% CI 13-65), including 4 CRs. At a median follow-up of 35 months, the median progression free/overall survival (PFS/OS) was 8.4/23.1 months. Grade 1-2 treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were common, while grade 3 or higher events occurred in only 10 patients (20%) and 7 patients experienced serious TRAEs (14%); 2 discontinued treatment due to drug-related toxicity. Notably, quality of life improved, especially in patients with perianogenital primaries. CONCLUSIONS: Avelumab in combination with cetuximab demonstrates encouraging clinical activity in advanced cSCC, including patients with challenging subgroups such as perianogenital primaries or those with disease that has progressed on anti-PD-1 monotherapy. This is especially true when patients are carefully selected for their ability to undergo treatment for at least 12 weeks.",

          "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. In recent years, the therapeutic arsenal of locally advanced or metastatic ATC has been expanded, with V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-MAPKK  inhibitors for the subset of -mutant ATC. For  wild-type ATC and without other actionable alterations, the most promising strategy is certainly immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown activities both in monotherapy or in combination regimens. However, access to novel treatments is heterogeneous worldwide for ATC patients, and activity of immunotherapy as a single agent is limited. We report the case of a patient with locally advanced  wild-type ATC who achieved a near-complete and durable response following a multimodal treatment approach combining chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), and external beam radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was continued as maintenance therapy, and disease control was maintained for over 1 year. This case highlights the potential efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in  wild-type ATC, especially when a rapid tumor reduction is required. It supports the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with cytotoxic agents as a viable therapeutic option in this aggressive tumor subtype.",

          "abstract": "Melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, is commonly associated by mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly BRAFV600E, which drives tumor proliferation via ERK1/2 signaling cascade. While BRAF inhibitors initially demonstrate efficacy, therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence implicates the cAMP signaling pathway, particularly the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and its repressor, Inducible cAMP Early Repressor (ICER), in melanoma progression and drug resistance. ICER, a transcriptional repressor regulated via Ras/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination, is degraded in melanoma, undermining its tumor-suppressive role. In a brafV600E; p53(loss of function) transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model, we investigated the role of a ubiquitin-resistant ICER mutant (S35-41A-ICER) in tumor progression. Transgenic fish expressing S35-41A-ICER exhibited extended survival and reduced tumor invasiveness compared to wild-type ICER. RNA sequencing revealed dysregulation of CREB/CREM targets and compensatory pathways, including Rap1 and PI3K/AKT signaling, as well as candidate gene targets of ICER regulation, including the Protein Kinase A catalytic subunit prkacaa. Our findings suggest that a ubiquitin resistant ICER mitigates melanoma progression and represses oncogenic pathways in a brafV600E melanoma context.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Most patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma eventually develop resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) and immune-checkpoint blockade. Emerging evidence from retrospective cohorts indicates promising activity from re-exposure to BRAF/MEKi after a treatment-free interval of targeted therapy (TT), probably due to tumor regression and proliferation of sensitive clones. However, there is limited prospective evidence on this approach. METHODS/PATIENTS: GEM1801 is a prospective observational study by the Spanish Melanoma Group (GEM), including 1123 patients treated at 37 centers. We conducted a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for the 24 patients who received a second course of BRAF/MEKi, either as retreatment (after relapse following prior adjuvant TT) or rechallenge (following prior progression on TT in the metastatic setting). RESULTS: Five patients underwent retreatment, and 19 received rechallenge. The BRAF/MEKi median free interval for retreatment was 20.9\u00a0months (range 12.4-57.3), with an ORR of 20%, and median PFS and OS of 5.5 and 8.4\u00a0months, respectively. The median free interval of TT for rechallenge was 6.8\u00a0months, with an ORR of 31.6%, and median PFS and OS of 5.7 and 7.6\u00a0months. Patients with ECOG\u2009\u2264\u20091 experienced longer survival with rechallenge (8.2 vs 4.3\u00a0months; HR 9.07 [95% CI 1.37-59.8]; p\u2009=\u20090.022). CONCLUSION: Retreatment or rechallenge with BRAF/MEKi in the metastatic setting has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma who lack therapeutic alternatives to prolong survival. Therefore, in our experience, it may represent a valid therapeutic strategy for selected patients. CLINICALTRIALS: GOV: NCT03605771 (REGISTRATION DATE: 20-07-2018): NCT03605771.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is notorious for its aggressive growth, metastatic spread, and heterogeneous response to therapy across BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase) genotypes. While BRAF inhibitors improve outcomes in V600E-mutant tumors, their benefit is limited in wild-type melanomas and by transient responses in mutant disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) driven angiogenesis and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) mediated immunosuppression each sculpt a permissive tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that simultaneous blockade of both axes with SYHA1813, which currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials in China for solid tumor treatment, would yield a broadly applicable, microenvironment-targeted strategy for melanoma treatment. METHODS: Subcutaneous xenograft models of BRAF wild-type (MeWo) and BRAF V600E-mutant (A375) melanoma were established (NOD-SCID mice), alongside an intracardiac metastasis model (Nude mice) using GFP-Luc-labeled A375 cells. SYHA1813 (2.5\u00a0mg/kg or 5\u00a0mg/kg), alone or combined with vemurafenib (20\u00a0mg/kg), was administered to assess tumor growth, metastatic burden, and microenvironmental modulation. Tumor growth inhibition rates and synergistic effects were quantified. The markers of angiogenesis, macrophage polarization and cell proliferation were analyzed via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SYHA1813 monotherapy exhibited significant antitumor efficacy in BRAF wild-type MeWo and BRAF V600E-mutant A375 melanoma xenograft models at 5\u00a0mg/kg, achieving 72.5% and 79.8% tumor growth inhibition, respectively, surpassing vemurafenib in BRAF wild-type tumors. Treatment regimens were well tolerated, with no significant body weight changes observed. Mechanistically, SYHA1813 suppressed angiogenesis, attenuated M2 macrophage infiltration, and inhibited tumor cell proliferation as marked by reduced CD31, CD105, F4/80, CD206 and Ki67 expression. Moreover, we evaluated the combination of SYHA1813 with vemurafenib in BRAF V600E-mutant models and found that 2.5\u00a0mg/kg SYHA1813 treatment synergized with vemurafenib, enhancing tumor suppression to 72.9% inhibition compared to each monotherapy (38.9% and 34.7%, respectively). Furthermore, we established a systemic intracardiac metastasis mouse model to assess the impact of SYHA1813 on melanoma metastasis. The results showed that SYHA1813 reduced systemic metastasis by 76.6%, significantly curtailing brain and bone metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Dual targeting of VEGFR2 and CSF1R with SYHA1813 confers a novel microenvironmentcentric strategy for treating both BRAF wildtype and mutant melanoma. By concurrently disrupting angiogenesis and macrophagemediated immunosuppression, SYHA1813 demonstrates strong therapeutic and antimetastatic activity to melanoma, warranting further clinical development as monotherapy or in combination with BRAF V600E inhibitors.",

However, surgical or minimally invasive treatment is rarely optimal due to the risk of treatment complications, and a complete cure is often difficult to achieve. Targeted therapy can be guided by the current understanding of molecular signalling pathways and disease classifications. Existing and novel medical treatments target the major cellular signalling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular malformations: mTOR inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphsophate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) inhibitors, and AKT inhibitors are being developed to target the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway, while mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors and BRAF inhibitor are being researched to target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Angiogenesis inhibitors are also utilised in the treatment of vascular abnormalities. This review aims to discuss the evolving medical therapy available in the treatment of Vascular Malformations.",

          "abstract": "The cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis controls heterotrimeric G proteins, and mutations reducing GTPase activity result in constitutive G protein signaling. In G\u03b1q (gene: GNAQ) such mutations cause uveal melanoma and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Finding pharmacological agents that inhibit G\u03b1q will be beneficial for research with therapeutic potential. Previously discovered bacterial depsipeptides (FR900359 and YM-254890) bind directly to G\u03b1q and stabilize its inactive complex with GDP, but suffer from limitations of distribution and bioavailability. We used the established G\u03b1q-YM-254890 complex structure to dock small-molecule drugs into the depsipeptide binding site of G\u03b1q. Our in silico screen of 5000 Food Drug and Administration-approved, experimental, and withdrawn drugs predicted that thiazolidinediones are potential ligands of G\u03b1q. Analysis of G protein coupled receptor-stimulated G protein GTP\u03b3S binding demonstrated that troglitazone (441 Da) inhibited Gq nucleotide exchange with the IC of \u223c31.7 \u03bcM. The thiazolidinedione analogs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, had no effect. High concentrations of troglitazone modestly inhibited Gi and Gs, but not G13. In G protein thermal stability assays, troglitazone and FR900359 stabilized purified G\u03b1q-GDP, indicating direct binding. Consistent with its negative effect on Gq signaling, in MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells, troglitazone inhibited Ca mobilization, extracellular regulated protein kinase phosphorylation, and insulin secretion stimulated by the Gq-coupled M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Troglitazone and FR900359 inhibited proliferation of MEL92.1 uveal melanoma cells driven by a GNAQ-Q209L driver mutation, but not of SK-MEL-28 cells driven by BRAF-V600E. Together, our study shows that troglitazone may be a promising new lead for the development of a <500 Da small-molecule therapeutic G\u03b1q inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Troglitazone, unlike other thiazolidinediones, directly binds and inhibits activity of heterotrimeric G protein Gq, with a weaker effect on Gi. Troglitazone may find usage as a repurposed drug scaffold to build novel small-molecule G\u03b1q inhibitors with better bioavailability than depsipeptide G\u03b1q inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "The BRAF mutation is one of the most common genetic alterations in thyroid tumors, and intrinsic feedback mechanisms have limited the clinical application of BRAF-specific inhibitors. This study aims to investigate the potential biological function of the downstream overexpressed molecule NGEF following the BRAF mutation and its regulatory mechanisms. By integrating data from the CEO database, TCGA database, and clinical samples, we found that NGEF is highly expressed in thyroid cancer and is positively correlated with tumor size, local lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and disease-free survival. Intriguingly, analysis of TCGA data revealed that NGEF expression is significantly higher in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers. Subsequent validation demonstrated that NGEF expression is markedly elevated in BRAF-mutant cancer cell lines and BRAF-engineered cellular models compared to normal cells and BRAF-negative cancer cells. Functional experiments, pathway enrichment analysis, and investigations into phenotype-associated biomarkers further revealed that NGEF promotes invasion and migration of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. To explore the regulatory relationship between the BRAF mutation and NGEF expression, we used bioinformatics tools to predict transcription factors, conducted pathway inhibition experiments, and performed dual-luciferase reporter assays. These studies confirmed that BRAF regulates NGEF expression via the ERK/AP1 pathway. These findings suggest that NGEF enhances the invasive and migratory abilities of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells through BRAF/ERK/AP1 upregulation and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors poses an ongoing clinical challenge. We investigated molecularly matched combination therapies for treatment-refractory GIST, including drugs not previously combined in human studies. METHODS: Patients of all ages with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST treated with combination therapies were included (February 13, 2015-December 31, 2022). These patients were discussed at molecular tumor board and enrolled in the prospective Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (I-PREDICT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02534675). Patient demographics, tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS), treatment responses, and survival outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Six (1.6%) patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 59.5 years with the majority (4/6) of patients being male. NGS revealed median of six deleterious genomic alterations per patient excluding variants of unknown significance. Five (5/6) patients had -mutant GIST, and one patient had -mutant GIST. Two thirds of tumors had  loss. Patients received median of 1 (range, 1-3) customized combination therapy consisting of median of 2 (range, 2-3) drugs targeting median of 2 (range, 2-4) genomic alterations. One patient experienced a treatment-related grade \u22653 adverse event (hypertension). For all patients, the best response by RECIST v1.1 was stable disease (SD). Combination therapies led to SD \u22656 months (range, 6.2-11.3 months) in four (4/6) patients compared with none in the immediate previous single-agent targeted therapies (SD range, 1.5-5.4 months). Most (5/6) patients had at least 60% prolongation of their progression-free survival compared with their immediate previous single-agent targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a multitargeted, biomarker-matched combination approach can be safely administered to obtain disease control. Tailored combination therapies for advanced GIST with multiple genomic alterations warrant further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Targeting the cell cycle has become a focus of cancer research bearing impressive results with the introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, no definitive benefit in other cancers has been observed. In gastrointestinal cancers, despite preclinical studies pinpointing positive effects on cancer inhibition in pre-clinical models, no positive clinical trials have been published with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Several biomarkers have been proposed in breast cancers, where the field is more advanced, and include up-regulations of the inhibited kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and their partner cyclin D as well as the main target of phosphorylation, RB. Up-regulation of Cyclin E, an E2F1/RB regulated gene, also arises as a marker of CDK4/6 inhibition resistance. Signaling from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways through KRAS/BRAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are also implicated in feedback CDK4/6 activation and inhibitors resistance. In gastrointestinal cancers, some of these biomarkers have also proven valuable in predicting sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors and would lead markers to guide clinical development. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment, where immune cells are prominent components, arises as a feature of CDK4/6 inhibition and could be harnessed in therapeutic combinations.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene fusions exist with low prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC), and the clinical utility of fusion testing in advanced CRC remains unclear. We sought to identify oncogenic fusions in patients with advanced CRC using a fusion partner-agnostic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay to better understand their clinical relevance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using de-identified data from 18,558 patients with advanced CRC who underwent ctDNA next-generation sequencing with Guardant360 from 2017 to 2022. These samples were subsequently reanalyzed with a partner-agnostic bioinformatics method to identify both clonal and non-clonal fusions. We analyzed for associations between fusions and MSI-H status, as well prior EGFR-directed therapy signature. RESULTS: Fusions were identified in 221 (1.3%) of CRC patients analyzed. 193 patients had 258 activating fusions, while 28 patients had fusions of uncertain significance. Among patients with activating fusions, there were 18 clonal fusions (7%) and 240 (93%) subclonal fusions. Clonal fusions were more common in patients with MSI-H status, and subclonal fusions were associated with prior EGFR exposure signature. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CRC, partner-agnostic ctDNA fusion detection is possible and improves identification as a blood-based approach by extension of fusion calling partners. Detection of fusions in the ctDNA may provide rationale for potential therapeutic strategies according to clonality as informed by the ctDNA, whereas subclonal fusions may play a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF tumors.",

          "abstract": "This review provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular biology and therapeutic advances regarding papillary craniopharyngiomas (PCP), with a particular focus on the pivotal role of the BRAF V600E mutation in its pathogenesis. Histopathologically, PCPs are characterized by stratified squamous epithelium and are frequently associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. This mutation activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which drives tumor development and progression. The identification of this pathway has led to significant progress in targeted therapies, specifically with the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in clinical trials. These inhibitors can effectively reduce tumor size and improve clinical outcomes for patients. However, despite these advancements, there are challenges such as the potential for resistance to these therapies and the management of long-term side effects. Consequently, a multidisciplinary approach that combines surgical resection, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy is often recommended to enhance treatment efficacy although minimizing adverse effects. In addition to adult cases, this review also addresses rare instances of pediatric PCP. Although these cases are infrequent, their molecular characteristics closely resemble those of adult PCP, suggesting that similar therapeutic approaches might be applicable. Looking ahead, future research should focus on optimizing treatment regimens, understanding the interactions within the tumor's immune microenvironment, and identifying novel therapeutic targets. These efforts are crucial for enhancing precision medicine strategies for PCP patients, ultimately improving their quality of life and long-term prognosis. Overall, continued exploration in this field holds promise for more effective and tailored treatment options.",

          "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Drugs targeting mutant BRAF and MEK oncogenes are effective in melanoma, even though resistance rapidly develops. This complex picture includes acquired intrinsic tumor and tumor microenvironmental-mediated mechanisms. Here we show that melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) overexpress the rate-limiting enzymes involved in nicotinamide (NAM) metabolism nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). Remarkably, these cells release NAMPT and NNMT both in the free-form or loaded into extracellular vesicles (EVs). NAMPT is emerging as a key mediator of resistance to BRAFi in melanoma, primarily due to its established role in NAD biosynthesis. Although previously identified as a soluble extracellular factor in this tumor, its presence within EVs released by melanoma cells has not been reported until now, highlighting a previously unrecognized mechanism through which NAMPT may influence the tumor microenvironment (TME). NNMT was revealed to increase in melanoma lesions compared to benign nevi. Here, we report for the first time its overexpression in resistant melanoma cell lines at intracellular and extracellular levels (secreted both as a soluble factor and into EVs). NNMT expression is increased in BRAF-mutated melanoma patients, suggesting a link between its upregulation and the BRAF oncogenic signaling. Moreover, NNMT levels positively correlate with gene signatures associated with pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell migration, and chemokine-mediated pathways. NNMT pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing significantly reduce resistant melanoma cell growth. In addition, we found that BRAFi-resistant cells are more sensitive to NNMT inhibition, highlighting a trait of vulnerability of BRAFi-resistant melanomas. Lastly, we proposed for the first time a tetrameric NNMT:TLR4 binding model offering a plausible structural and mechanistic basis for their association. Our functional results indicated that exogenous NNMT treatment is able to trigger NF-\u03baB pathway, one of the main TLR4-dependent signaling, sharing this cytokine-like properties with NAMPT, and opening a future deeper exploration of its functional role in the extracellular space. Overall, the identification of NAMPT and, surprisingly also NNMT, included in EVs and abundantly released from resistant melanoma cells supports the impact of these moonlighting proteins involved in nicotinamide metabolism as mediators of BRAF/MEK inhibitors resistance with tumor intrinsic and potentially tumor microenvironment-mediated mechanisms. Interfering with nicotinamide metabolism could be a valid strategy to counteract drug resistance acting on the multifactorial tumor-host interactions.

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prognostic impact of the BRAF V600E mutation in patients with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is poorly understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective international study included patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC treated with ICI all lines between 2014 and 2023, and available BRAF mutation status. RESULTS: Of 909 patients included, 345 (38\u202f%) had BRAF V600E dMMR/MSI mCRC. In multivariable analysis, BRAFm was not associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ICI start compared to BRAFwt patients (median PFS: 25.0 vs 41.5 months, adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR)=\u202f0.97, p\u202f=\u202f0.8 and OS: 55.1 months vs not reached adjHR=\u202f0.98, p\u202f=\u202f0.9). However, in patients treated with ICI in first line, the rate of secondary resistance, defined as the progression after the first 6 months of treatment, was higher in BRAFm patients (20\u202f% vs 11\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In patients with disease control for 6 months in 1st line, the PFS and OS from this point onwards were significantly shorter in BRAFm patients (adjHR for PFS 2.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.03 and adjHR for OS 2.80, p\u202f=\u202f0.019). The poor prognostic value of the BRAF mutation was no longer observed in patients treated with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC, the BRAF V600E mutation is not associated with a shorter PFS/OS on ICI treatment in the overall population across all lines. However, specifically in patients treated in the first-line setting, our results suggest that the BRAF mutation is associated with a higher rate of secondary resistance, suggesting that a combination of PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors upfront may be of particular interest in these patients.",

          "abstract": "A new group of thiadiazole-benzenesulfonamide hybrids was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as potential dual inhibitors targeting B-Raf and VEGFR-2 for cancer therapy. The cytotoxic activity of the synthesized derivatives was assessed against HepG2 and Huh7 liver cancer cell lines, where compound 7a exhibited the most potent activity with IC values of 17.89\u2009\u03bcM and 25.07\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. The kinase inhibition assay revealed that 7a strongly inhibited both B-Raf (IC\u2009=\u20090.11\u2009\u03bcM) and VEGFR-2 (IC\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009\u03bcM), surpassing sorafenib in B-Raf inhibition. Further mechanistic studies revealed that 7a induced G2/M phase arrest, with a significant increase in late apoptotic cells (57.08%) compared to the control group (0.15%), confirming its pro-apoptotic effect. The apoptotic pathway was further validated by caspase-3 activation, Bax upregulation, and Bcl-2 downregulation. Computational analyses verified the effective binding of compound 7a to VEGFR-2. These analyses included molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA), protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (ProLIF), principal component analysis (PCAT), and free energy landscape (FEL) studies. Additionally, DFT studies indicated 7a's stability and reactivity. In silico ADMET predictions indicated that the derivatives had good absorption, were non-mutagenic, non-carcinogenic, and exhibited low toxicity risks compared to sorafenib. These findings suggest that the synthesized thiadiazole-benzenesulfonamide hybrids, particularly 7a, represent promising dual BRAF/VEGFR-2 inhibitors with potent anti-cancer activity, warranting further optimization and preclinical evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Drug resistance critically limits the long-term efficacy of MAPK-targeted therapy in melanoma. While resistance mechanisms at genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional scales are well-documented, post-transcriptional splicing regulation remains poorly understood. By analyzing patient-matched pre-treatment and resistant melanoma biopsies, we uncover widespread alternative splicing alterations during therapy resistance. Splicing perturbations are most pronounced in MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathway genes. We identify a splicing switch of AKT2 from isoform 210 to 206 in 29.55% (13/44) of disease-progressive biopsies. This splicing switch induces AKT2 kinase hyperactivity by restoring the activated fragment A-loop. Functional validations confirm that AKT2-206 confers BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma cells by activating S6 kinase. Further, the splicing factor hnRNPK likely drives the splicing switch of AKT2 during acquired resistance. Our results not only provide insights into splicing-mediated regulation of drug resistance but also highlight the importance of alternative splicing isoforms as targets for clinical diagnosis and therapy.",

Among these, HpNGNs that predominantly exhibit foveolar-cell differentiation include foveolar-type gastric adenomas (FGA) and fundic gland polyps with dysplasia (FGPD). Traditionally, FGAs have been considered large, whitish, flat lesions (flat-type FGA), primarily associated with syndromic conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS), while sporadic cases are rare. This type exhibits a gastric immunophenotype with diverse differentiation, mainly toward foveolar cells, and harbors APC and KRAS mutations in all sporadic and most syndromic cases. A distinct subset of FGAs, termed foveolar-type gastric adenoma with a raspberry-like appearance (FGA-RA), has been identified. It presents as small, reddish polyps with unique macroscopic and microscopic features and only occurs sporadically. FGA-RA often mimics gastric hyperplastic polyps macroscopically and typically exhibits low-grade dysplasia, making biopsy-based diagnosis challenging and leading to its historical underrecognition. It shows pure foveolar differentiation and consistently harbors Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) mutations. FGPD primarily develops sporadically in -na\u00efve individuals with long-term proton pump inhibitor use. A syndromic form, resembling flat-type FGAs, is also associated with FAP and GAPPS. Histologically, FGPD features dysplasia confined to the superficial foveolar epithelium and mucus neck cells overlying fundic gland polyps, with APC mutations detected in approximately 50% of cases. This review explores the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HpNGNs with predominant foveolar cell differentiation, emphasizing the need for an updated histological diagnostic framework.",

We further discuss the use of KRAS as a prognostic biomarker and explore promising non-antibiotic interventions-such as phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and targeted small-molecule inhibitors-aimed at selectively disrupting  colonization and virulence.

          "abstract": "Lung cancer is a highly diverse disease, and reliable preclinical models that accurately reflect tumor characteristics are essential for studying lung cancer biology and testing new therapies. This study aimed to establish patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) using small biopsy samples and surgical specimens to create a model system that preserves the genetic and histological features of the original tumors.  PDTOs were generated from 163 lung cancer specimens, including 109 samples obtained using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or bronchoscopy, 52 surgical specimens, and 2 pleural fluid samples. The organoid establishment rate beyond passage three was assessed, and histological subtypes and genetic profiles were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining and targeted exome sequencing.  The overall PDTO establishment rate was 34.4% (56/163), and 44.6% (25/56) of these organoids retained the histological and genetic features of the parental tumors. Genetic analysis identified key mutations, including KRAS G12C, EGFR L858R, MET exon 14 skipping mutation, and ROS1 fusion. PDTOs successfully formed tumors in mice while maintaining the genetic characteristics of the original tumors. Co-culture of PDTOs with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) resulted in increased resistance to paclitaxel. In the co-culture model of PDTOs with immune cells, dose-dependent growth inhibition of PDTOs was observed in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  PDTOs established from small biopsy and surgical specimens serve as a valuable model for studying lung cancer biology, tumor microenvironment interactions, and drug response. This model has the potential to improve personalized treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype with poor prognosis. Outcomes to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and genomic features in PSC remain underexplored compared to other NSCLC subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from three institutions and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) with metastatic NSCLC treated with ICI alone or with chemotherapy were identified. Clinicogenomics and treatment outcomes were compared across PSC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). RESULTS: We analyzed 4,841 patients including 165 PSC cases treated with ICI-based therapy from three institutions, and 201 PSC from NCDB. In MDACC, 65 (4.3%) were PSC, 1,138 (75.1%) LUAD, and 312 (20.6%) LUSC. PSC patients were older and more likely to present with metastatic disease. In both the MDACC and NCDB cohorts, ICIs resulted in better outcomes for PSC patients compared with chemotherapy. In these patients, there was no difference in outcome between ICI-monotherapy and ICI-chemotherapy. Across the three institutional cohorts, 37%-43% of patients with PSC who received ICIs were responders, compared to 26%-29% in LUAD and 22%-46% in LUSC (P < 0.05). Improved ICI outcomes in PSC appeared driven by high PD-L1 (\u226550% in 73%-77% cases). Among patients with high PD-L1, response rates were similar across histologic subtypes. Conversely, TMB was similar in PSC compared to LUAD/LUSC, and was not associated with ICI outcomes. Across cohorts, PSC tumors were enriched for TP53, NF1, NF2, and NRAS, with relative depletion of STK11 and KEAP1 compared to LUAD. Case observation showed relatively better outcomes to ICI than targeted therapies in PSC patients with MET exon 14 skipping or KRAS G12C. CONCLUSION: PSC exhibits improved outcomes to ICI relative to other therapies, potentially driven by high PD-L1 expression. Genomic analysis highlights a distinct genomic landscape of PSC when compared with LUAD.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review investigates the complex association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and lung cancer, focusing on shared risk factors, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications. We aim to quantify the impact of T2DM on lung cancer incidence, progression, and treatment response, and evaluate the role of glycemic control and antidiabetic therapies. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted following a targeted search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for published studies. Search terms included \"type 2 diabetes mellitus,\" \"lung cancer,\" \"non-small cell lung cancer,\" \"hyperglycemia,\" \"insulin resistance,\" and relevant synonyms. Inclusion criteria were original research articles, meta-analyses, and clinical trials involving human subjects that explored epidemiological associations, molecular mechanisms, pharmacologic interventions, or prognostic implications of T2DM in lung cancer. Studies focusing solely on type 1 diabetes, animal models, or non-English language were excluded. Key findings were synthesized to provide mechanistic insights and clinical relevance. RESULTS: Epidemiological evidence indicates a 20-48% increased relative risk of lung cancer in individuals with T2DM, with incidence rates reaching 125 per 100,000 in diabetics versus 85 per 100,000 in non-diabetics. Shared risk factors include obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. Molecular pathways such as K-Ras and PI3K/Akt activation, IGF-1R overexpression, and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. Metformin is associated with reduced lung cancer incidence and improved progression-free survival (58% vs. 37% at 2 years). Pioglitazone and DPP4 inhibitors show potential benefits, though clinical evidence remains mixed. CONCLUSION: T2DM significantly influences lung cancer biology and prognosis. Integrating glycemic control with cancer therapy-particularly metformin and EGFR-TKI combinations-offers promising avenues for improving outcomes. Future research should focus on biomarker-driven stratification and targeted therapeutic strategies tailored to diabetic lung cancer patients.",

          "abstract": "IBI351 (also known as fulzerasib or GFH925), an irreversible covalent inhibitor of KRAS, has demonstrated promising anti-tumour activity in patients with solid tumours. In this study, data were pooled from the phase I part of two clinical studies (NCT05005234 and NCT05497336), aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IBI351 monotherapy in KRAS inhibitor-na\u00efve Chinese patients with KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). As of December 13, 2023, 56 patients treated with IBI351 monotherapy were included. The median duration of treatment was 7.7 months (range: 0.3-16.7). The confirmed ORR was 44.6% (95% CI: 31.3-58.5), with a DCR of 87.5% (95% CI: 75.9-94.8). With a median follow-up of 13.8 months, the median PFS was 8.1 months (95% CI: 5.5-13.8). The median OS was 17.0 months (95% CI: 12.6-not reached). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 53 patients (94.6%), with grade 3 TRAEs in 14 patients (25.0%). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. The most common grade 3 TRAEs were anaemia (n\u2009=\u20094, 7.1%) and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (n\u2009=\u20093, 5.4%). TRAEs led to dose interruption in 12 patients (21.4%) and dose reduction in six patients (10.7%). No TRAEs resulted in treatment discontinuation. IBI351 demonstrated encouraging clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile in KRAS inhibitor-na\u00efve Chinese patients with KRAS-mutated metastatic CRC.",

          "abstract": "The therapeutic benefit of recently developed mutant KRAS (KRAS\u2217) inhibitors remains limited by the rapid onset of resistance. Here, we aim to delineate mechanisms underlying acquired resistance and identify actionable targets for overcoming this clinical challenge. Previously, we identified syndecan-1 (SDC1) as a key effector for pancreatic cancer progression whose surface expression is driven by KRAS\u2217. By leveraging both pancreatic and colorectal cancer models, we show that surface SDC1 expression initially diminishes upon KRAS\u2217 inhibition but recovers in tumor cells that bypass KRAS\u2217 dependency. Mechanistically, we reveal that YAP1 activation drives the recovery of SDC1 surface localization to enhance macropinocytosis-mediated nutrient salvaging and activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases for tumor maintenance, promoting resistance to KRAS\u2217-targeted therapy. Overall, our study provides a strong rationale for targeting the YAP-SDC1 axis to overcome resistance to KRAS\u2217 inhibition, thereby revealing promising therapeutic opportunities for improving the clinical outcome of patients with KRAS\u2217-mutated cancers.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncolytic virus (OV)-mediated immunotherapy has been shown limited efficacy. Small molecule inhibitors specific to the KRAS driver oncoprotein have recently been developed for cancer treatment. The combination of a potent OV with a KRAS inhibitor could be a potent combination strategy for treating KRAS cancer. METHODS: We explored combination therapies using KRAS inhibitor and OV in cancer cells in vitro and in two KRAS cancer models. We employed flow cytometry to evaluate the immune cell profiles, including dendritic cells, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, natural killer (NK), subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3), activation markers (granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB) as well as enzyme-linked immunospot assay to identify tumor-antigen specific T cells. The importance of CD4, CD8 T and NK cells in the therapeutic effects was evaluated by antibody-mediated depletion in vivo. RESULTS: We confirmed that three inhibitors for KRAS, AMG510 (sotorasib), MRTX849 (adagrasib) and MRTX1257, all displayed potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells harboring KRAS, but not to cancer cells without this specific KRAS mutation in vitro. All three inhibitors exhibited potent antitumor activity in KRAS Lewis lung cancer, but not in MC38 colon cancer with wild-type KRAS. In two KRAS tumor models, either an IL-36\u03b3-armed OV or orally delivered MRTX1257 inhibited tumor growth, but the combination worked much more efficiently, and efficacy was further improved with PD-1 blockade although with no statistical difference in survival, leading to complete tumor remission in a large fraction of the mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that MRTX1257, and other KRAS inhibitors as well, are potent inducers of antitumor immunity by themselves, and that it worked with OV to elicit potent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immunity. The combination therapeutic efficacy depended largely on increased tumor-specific CD8 cytotoxic T cells, and to a smaller degree, on CD4 T and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Small molecule inhibitors of KRAS are novel inducers of tumor-specific immunity, and a unique triple combination regimen is highly efficacious through elicited potent antitumor immunity for KRAS cancers.",

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy [progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)] of first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) with or/without (\u00b1) chemotherapy (ChT) versus ChT alone against advanced PSCs (APSCs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the French Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics Lung Cancer (ESME-LC) database (2015-2022), we analyzed APSC patients' first-line ICI \u00b1 ChT or ChT outcomes, then applied propensity score weighting to indirectly compare them. RESULTS: Among 42 219 patients with untreated lung cancers, 229 (0.5%) had APSCs. One hundred and sixty-one (70.3%) received first-line treatment (43 ICI alone, 24 ICI + ChT, 94 ChT alone): median age, 66 years; 70.2% men; 69.8% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1, among 106 available values; 86.2% smokers or former smokers. Molecular testing was done for 113/161 (70.2%) patients, 35.4% of whom had a molecular abnormality, most frequently a KRAS mutation (39.7%). Programmed death-ligand 1 tumor proportion scores determined for 43.5% of tumors (70/161) were: 68.6% \u226550%, 8.6% 1%-49%, and 22.9% <1%. For the ICI \u00b1 ChT group, median PFS and OS were 4.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-8.2 months] and 20.6 months (95% CI 10.3-32.4 months), respectively. For ChT-alone recipients, median PFS and OS were 2.2 months (95% CI 2.0-3.0 months) and 6.8 months (95% CI 4.3-10.0 months), respectively. Applying a propensity score, ICI \u00b1 ChT was significantly associated with longer PFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.72, P < 0.001) and longer OS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.74, P = 0.002) than ChT alone. CONCLUSION: According to this real-world analysis, first-line ICI \u00b1 ChT seems to have considerably improved the prognosis of APSCs.",

          "abstract": "Mutant RAS proteins are among the most prevalent drivers of human cancer, and the glycine to aspartic acid mutation at codon 12 (G12D) is the most common variant. Mutation-selective covalent inhibitors spare RAS in healthy tissue and enable extended pharmacodynamic effect, but covalent targeting of RAS is hindered by low nucleophilicity and high proteomic abundance of carboxylic acids. We overcame these challenges with compounds that bind cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic protein-protein interface between CYPA and active RAS that enables selective, enzyme-like rate enhancement of the covalent reaction between D12 and electrophilic warheads with exceptionally low intrinsic reactivity. This approach yielded orally bioavailable compounds with marked antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models of KRAS cancers, including the investigational agent zoldonrasib (RMC-9805) currently undergoing clinical evaluation (NCT06040541).",

          "abstract": "Selective RET inhibitors such as pralsetinib have become the standard of care for patients with RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Serial analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has proven effective in monitoring disease control/progression and therapeutic response in NSCLC. In this prospective study, we analyzed longitudinal ctDNA profiles (at baseline, week 8, and at progression) in Chinese patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC treated with pralsetinib (NCT03037385), utilizing allele frequency-based, cfDNA quantity-normalized, and methylation-based metrics. Associations between ctDNA dynamics, tumor response, and genomic alterations were assessed. A total of 21 patients were enrolled. Baseline PIK3CA co-mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; 3.0 vs. 12.4 months, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Superior PFS was observed in patients with lower baseline ctDNA levels across all metrics: allele frequency-based (HR\u2009=\u20090.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.80; P\u2009=\u20090.012), cfDNA quantity-normalized (HR\u2009=\u20090.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.71; P\u2009=\u20090.006), and methylation-based (HR\u2009=\u20090.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.85; P\u2009=\u20090.010). Early ctDNA clearance at the first radiographic assessment was also associated with prolonged PFS (median PFS not reached vs. 4.8 months; P\u2009=\u20090.002) and enhanced disease control (71.4% vs. 0%). Moreover, three distinct ctDNA dynamic profiles-clearance-rebound, reduction-rebound, and sustained clearance-were associated with different progression patterns (systemic progression, new extrathoracic lesions, new intracranial/intrathoracic lesions). No evidence of histologic transformation was identified at the time of progression. KRAS G12R and other non-canonical alterations emerged in ctDNA-rebound samples. Molecular progression preceded radiographic progression by a mean interval of 2.2 months. These findings suggest that ctDNA-based surveillance using multiple metrics, enables early forecasting of tumor response and progression in RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Early ctDNA clearance and dynamic profiles provide non-invasive biomarkers for early intervention, warranting further validation with ctDNA-guided strategies.",

          "abstract": "SOS1 plays a pivotal role in RAS activation and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for tumors driven by KRAS mutations. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of SOS1 inhibitors based on the 5,8-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one scaffold. Biological evaluation revealed that most compounds displayed anti-proliferative activity against K562 leukemia cells. Among these, A15f and B5a emerged as the most potent compounds comparable to BI-3406. A15f and B5a exhibited inhibitory activity against KRAS-G12C/SOS1 complex formation, with IC\u2085\u2080 value of 40.28 and 11.11\u00a0nM respectively and led to a dose-dependent decrease in pERK levels. The combination therapy of KRAS G12C inhibitor and A15f shows enhanced in vitro efficacy. Molecular docking revealed that these two compounds shared a conserved binding mode with SOS1, similar to the reported inhibitors. These findings provide foundation for further development of SOS1-targeted anticancer therapeutics and offer valuable insights for structural optimization of this novel class of inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "Targeting the cell cycle has become a focus of cancer research bearing impressive results with the introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, no definitive benefit in other cancers has been observed. In gastrointestinal cancers, despite preclinical studies pinpointing positive effects on cancer inhibition in pre-clinical models, no positive clinical trials have been published with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Several biomarkers have been proposed in breast cancers, where the field is more advanced, and include up-regulations of the inhibited kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and their partner cyclin D as well as the main target of phosphorylation, RB. Up-regulation of Cyclin E, an E2F1/RB regulated gene, also arises as a marker of CDK4/6 inhibition resistance. Signaling from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways through KRAS/BRAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are also implicated in feedback CDK4/6 activation and inhibitors resistance. In gastrointestinal cancers, some of these biomarkers have also proven valuable in predicting sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors and would lead markers to guide clinical development. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment, where immune cells are prominent components, arises as a feature of CDK4/6 inhibition and could be harnessed in therapeutic combinations.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oncogenic activation of KRAS is a common driver of solid tumor malignancies and has been considered 'undruggable' for several decades. Oral small molecule inhibitors, including sotorasib and adagrasib, have demonstrated moderate efficacy in targeting KRAS G12C in NSCLC. More potent inhibitors are needed, and the landscape is rapidly evolving. AREAS COVERED: Opnurasib (JDQ-443) is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of GDP-bound KRAS G12C that has been under investigation in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors, including NSCLC. Here, we review its mechanism of action, pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy, role within the NSCLC landscape prior to its withdrawal from the market, as well as the regulatory and market-driven dynamics that may result in the abandonment of aspiring drugs. EXPERT OPINION: JDQ-443's unique binding within the Switch II pocket of KRAS G12C allows for novel interactions and helps define its characteristic profile of anti-tumor activity, tolerability, and resistance. JDQ-443\u00a0has demonstrated promising early clinical activity in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. More data is necessary to allow comparison of available agents and combination strategies. In the face of an expanding market, development of JDQ-443\u00a0has been halted despite promising safety and efficacy outcomes and ongoing innovative trials, highlighting critical challenges in the drug development process. The existing body of work characterizing JDQ-443 remains extremely informative.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The limited response rates of immune checkpoint inhibitors in biliary tract cancers (BTC) highlight the need for effective biomarkers to optimize patient selection. METHODS: Baseline tumor tissues from 125 patients with advanced BTC treated with first-line chemoimmunotherapy (chemoIO) were analyzed using targeted DNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the role of identified biomarkers in BTC. RESULTS: Mutations in TP53, BRCA2, cytokine genes, and high tumor mutation burden were significantly associated with treatment response. In contrast, KRAS G12D and ARID1A mutations were linked to poorer survival outcomes. High expression levels of CXCL9 and CTLA4 expression were associated with improved treatment response, prolonged progression-free survival, and overall survival. Using these biomarkers, patients were categorized into three molecular subtypes, with Type I patients demonstrating the most favorable outcomes under chemoIO. Subsequent RNA analysis revealed that elevated CXCL9 expression was associated with increased immune checkpoint expression within the tumor and heightened immune activity in the tumor microenvironment. In the mouse orthotopic cholangiocarcinoma model, CXCL9 overexpression enhanced chemoIO efficacy. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry showed that CXCL9 promoted T-cell infiltration and activation. In vitro experiments using multiple BTC cell lines further demonstrated that CXCL9 was essential for maintaining T cell cytotoxicity. The immune-modulatory effects of CXCL9/CTLA4 and their predictive value for treatment efficacy were further validated in a multicenter BTC cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several predictive biomarkers associated with the response and efficacy of chemoIO in advanced BTC, offering valuable insights into patient stratification and refining therapeutic strategies.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene fusions exist with low prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC), and the clinical utility of fusion testing in advanced CRC remains unclear. We sought to identify oncogenic fusions in patients with advanced CRC using a fusion partner-agnostic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay to better understand their clinical relevance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using de-identified data from 18,558 patients with advanced CRC who underwent ctDNA next-generation sequencing with Guardant360 from 2017 to 2022. These samples were subsequently reanalyzed with a partner-agnostic bioinformatics method to identify both clonal and non-clonal fusions. We analyzed for associations between fusions and MSI-H status, as well prior EGFR-directed therapy signature. RESULTS: Fusions were identified in 221 (1.3%) of CRC patients analyzed. 193 patients had 258 activating fusions, while 28 patients had fusions of uncertain significance. Among patients with activating fusions, there were 18 clonal fusions (7%) and 240 (93%) subclonal fusions. Clonal fusions were more common in patients with MSI-H status, and subclonal fusions were associated with prior EGFR exposure signature. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CRC, partner-agnostic ctDNA fusion detection is possible and improves identification as a blood-based approach by extension of fusion calling partners. Detection of fusions in the ctDNA may provide rationale for potential therapeutic strategies according to clonality as informed by the ctDNA, whereas subclonal fusions may play a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF tumors.",

We found that KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines were sensitive to the RAS(ON) multiselective RAS inhibitor RMC-7977, given that treatment resulted in RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibition; halted proliferation; and, in some cases, induced apoptosis. RMC-7977 initially reduced the activity of a compartment-specific, dual-color reporter of ERK activity, with reporter reactivation emerging after long-term dose escalation. These drug-resistant cell populations exhibited distinct patterns of phospho-protein abundance, transcriptional activities, and genomic mutations, including a Y71H mutation in KRAS and an S257L mutation in RAF1. Transgenic expression of KRAS or RAF1 in drug-sensitive CRC cells induced resistance to RMC-7977. CRC cells that were resistant to RMC-7977 and harboring RAF1 exhibited synergistic sensitivity to concurrent inhibition of RAS and RAF. Our findings demonstrate the power of reporter-assisted screening together with single-cell analyses for dissecting the complex landscape of therapy resistance. The strategy offers opportunities to develop clinically relevant combinatorial treatments to counteract the emergence of resistant cancer cells.",

          "abstract": "CDKN2A/MTAP co-deletion occurs frequently in non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors, including glioblastoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and fewer than 15% of glioblastoma or pancreatic cancer patients survive 5 years, underscoring the need for more effective therapies. PRMT5 is a synthetic-lethal dependency in MTAP-null tumors and an attractive therapeutic target for CDKN2A/MTAP-deleted cancers. A new revolutionary class of inhibitors, referred to as MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors, has shown promising results in ongoing early phase clinical trials. Nonetheless, effective cancer treatment typically requires therapeutic combinations to improve response rates and defeat emergent resistant clones. Thus, we sought to determine whether perturbation of other pathways could improve the efficacy of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors. A paralog and single gene targeting CRISPR library was used to screen MTAP-deleted cancers in the presence or absence of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors. Loss of several genes sensitized to PRMT5 inhibition, including members of the MAPK pathway. Chemical inhibition of MAPK pathway members using KRAS, MEK, ERK, and RAF inhibitors synergized with PRMT5 inhibition to kill CDKN2A/MTAP-null, RAS-active tumors. Further, MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors combined with either KRAS or RAF inhibitors led to complete responses in vivo, emphasizing the potential benefit for patients. Lastly, cell lines resistant to KRAS inhibition were not resistant to MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors and vice versa, suggesting non-cross-reactive mechanisms of resistance. Overall, this study identifies therapeutic combinations with MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors that may offer significant benefit to patients.",
