      "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. In recent years, the therapeutic arsenal of locally advanced or metastatic ATC has been expanded, with V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-MAPKK  inhibitors for the subset of -mutant ATC. For  wild-type ATC and without other actionable alterations, the most promising strategy is certainly immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown activities both in monotherapy or in combination regimens. However, access to novel treatments is heterogeneous worldwide for ATC patients, and activity of immunotherapy as a single agent is limited. We report the case of a patient with locally advanced  wild-type ATC who achieved a near-complete and durable response following a multimodal treatment approach combining chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), and external beam radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was continued as maintenance therapy, and disease control was maintained for over 1 year. This case highlights the potential efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in  wild-type ATC, especially when a rapid tumor reduction is required. It supports the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with cytotoxic agents as a viable therapeutic option in this aggressive tumor subtype.",

      "abstract": "Melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, is commonly associated by mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly BRAFV600E, which drives tumor proliferation via ERK1/2 signaling cascade. While BRAF inhibitors initially demonstrate efficacy, therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence implicates the cAMP signaling pathway, particularly the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and its repressor, Inducible cAMP Early Repressor (ICER), in melanoma progression and drug resistance. ICER, a transcriptional repressor regulated via Ras/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination, is degraded in melanoma, undermining its tumor-suppressive role. In a brafV600E; p53(loss of function) transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model, we investigated the role of a ubiquitin-resistant ICER mutant (S35-41A-ICER) in tumor progression. Transgenic fish expressing S35-41A-ICER exhibited extended survival and reduced tumor invasiveness compared to wild-type ICER. RNA sequencing revealed dysregulation of CREB/CREM targets and compensatory pathways, including Rap1 and PI3K/AKT signaling, as well as candidate gene targets of ICER regulation, including the Protein Kinase A catalytic subunit prkacaa. Our findings suggest that a ubiquitin resistant ICER mitigates melanoma progression and represses oncogenic pathways in a brafV600E melanoma context.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Most patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma eventually develop resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) and immune-checkpoint blockade. Emerging evidence from retrospective cohorts indicates promising activity from re-exposure to BRAF/MEKi after a treatment-free interval of targeted therapy (TT), probably due to tumor regression and proliferation of sensitive clones. However, there is limited prospective evidence on this approach. METHODS/PATIENTS: GEM1801 is a prospective observational study by the Spanish Melanoma Group (GEM), including 1123 patients treated at 37 centers. We conducted a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for the 24 patients who received a second course of BRAF/MEKi, either as retreatment (after relapse following prior adjuvant TT) or rechallenge (following prior progression on TT in the metastatic setting). RESULTS: Five patients underwent retreatment, and 19 received rechallenge. The BRAF/MEKi median free interval for retreatment was 20.9\u00a0months (range 12.4-57.3), with an ORR of 20%, and median PFS and OS of 5.5 and 8.4\u00a0months, respectively. The median free interval of TT for rechallenge was 6.8\u00a0months, with an ORR of 31.6%, and median PFS and OS of 5.7 and 7.6\u00a0months. Patients with ECOG\u2009\u2264\u20091 experienced longer survival with rechallenge (8.2 vs 4.3\u00a0months; HR 9.07 [95% CI 1.37-59.8]; p\u2009=\u20090.022). CONCLUSION: Retreatment or rechallenge with BRAF/MEKi in the metastatic setting has shown clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma who lack therapeutic alternatives to prolong survival. Therefore, in our experience, it may represent a valid therapeutic strategy for selected patients. CLINICALTRIALS: GOV: NCT03605771 (REGISTRATION DATE: 20-07-2018): NCT03605771.",

The types of uveitis were pan-uveitis (38.5%), anterior uveitis (34.6%), posterior uveitis (15.4%), and intermediate uveitis (3.8%). Fifty percent of the patients were Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease-like uveitis. After discontinuation of dabrafenib and treatment with topical and systemic steroids, the symptoms of uveitis improved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients are advised to have regular ophthalmology examinations during the use of dabrafenib.

      "title": "Dual targeting of VEGFR2 and CSF1R with SYHA1813 confers novel strategy for treating both BRAF wild-type and mutant melanoma.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma is notorious for its aggressive growth, metastatic spread, and heterogeneous response to therapy across BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase) genotypes. While BRAF inhibitors improve outcomes in V600E-mutant tumors, their benefit is limited in wild-type melanomas and by transient responses in mutant disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) driven angiogenesis and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) mediated immunosuppression each sculpt a permissive tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that simultaneous blockade of both axes with SYHA1813, which currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials in China for solid tumor treatment, would yield a broadly applicable, microenvironment-targeted strategy for melanoma treatment. METHODS: Subcutaneous xenograft models of BRAF wild-type (MeWo) and BRAF V600E-mutant (A375) melanoma were established (NOD-SCID mice), alongside an intracardiac metastasis model (Nude mice) using GFP-Luc-labeled A375 cells. SYHA1813 (2.5\u00a0mg/kg or 5\u00a0mg/kg), alone or combined with vemurafenib (20\u00a0mg/kg), was administered to assess tumor growth, metastatic burden, and microenvironmental modulation. Tumor growth inhibition rates and synergistic effects were quantified. The markers of angiogenesis, macrophage polarization and cell proliferation were analyzed via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SYHA1813 monotherapy exhibited significant antitumor efficacy in BRAF wild-type MeWo and BRAF V600E-mutant A375 melanoma xenograft models at 5\u00a0mg/kg, achieving 72.5% and 79.8% tumor growth inhibition, respectively, surpassing vemurafenib in BRAF wild-type tumors. Treatment regimens were well tolerated, with no significant body weight changes observed. Mechanistically, SYHA1813 suppressed angiogenesis, attenuated M2 macrophage infiltration, and inhibited tumor cell proliferation as marked by reduced CD31, CD105, F4/80, CD206 and Ki67 expression. Moreover, we evaluated the combination of SYHA1813 with vemurafenib in BRAF V600E-mutant models and found that 2.5\u00a0mg/kg SYHA1813 treatment synergized with vemurafenib, enhancing tumor suppression to 72.9% inhibition compared to each monotherapy (38.9% and 34.7%, respectively). Furthermore, we established a systemic intracardiac metastasis mouse model to assess the impact of SYHA1813 on melanoma metastasis. The results showed that SYHA1813 reduced systemic metastasis by 76.6%, significantly curtailing brain and bone metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Dual targeting of VEGFR2 and CSF1R with SYHA1813 confers a novel microenvironmentcentric strategy for treating both BRAF wildtype and mutant melanoma. By concurrently disrupting angiogenesis and macrophagemediated immunosuppression, SYHA1813 demonstrates strong therapeutic and antimetastatic activity to melanoma, warranting further clinical development as monotherapy or in combination with BRAF V600E inhibitors.",

Traditional invasive treatment for vascular malformations includes embolo-sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy and surgery. However, surgical or minimally invasive treatment is rarely optimal due to the risk of treatment complications, and a complete cure is often difficult to achieve. Targeted therapy can be guided by the current understanding of molecular signalling pathways and disease classifications. Existing and novel medical treatments target the major cellular signalling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular malformations: mTOR inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphsophate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) inhibitors, and AKT inhibitors are being developed to target the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway, while mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors and BRAF inhibitor are being researched to target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Angiogenesis inhibitors are also utilised in the treatment of vascular abnormalities. This review aims to discuss the evolving medical therapy available in the treatment of Vascular Malformations.",

      "abstract": "The cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis controls heterotrimeric G proteins, and mutations reducing GTPase activity result in constitutive G protein signaling. In G\u03b1q (gene: GNAQ) such mutations cause uveal melanoma and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Finding pharmacological agents that inhibit G\u03b1q will be beneficial for research with therapeutic potential. Previously discovered bacterial depsipeptides (FR900359 and YM-254890) bind directly to G\u03b1q and stabilize its inactive complex with GDP, but suffer from limitations of distribution and bioavailability. We used the established G\u03b1q-YM-254890 complex structure to dock small-molecule drugs into the depsipeptide binding site of G\u03b1q. Our in silico screen of 5000 Food Drug and Administration-approved, experimental, and withdrawn drugs predicted that thiazolidinediones are potential ligands of G\u03b1q. Analysis of G protein coupled receptor-stimulated G protein GTP\u03b3S binding demonstrated that troglitazone (441 Da) inhibited Gq nucleotide exchange with the IC of \u223c31.7 \u03bcM. The thiazolidinedione analogs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, had no effect. High concentrations of troglitazone modestly inhibited Gi and Gs, but not G13. In G protein thermal stability assays, troglitazone and FR900359 stabilized purified G\u03b1q-GDP, indicating direct binding. Consistent with its negative effect on Gq signaling, in MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells, troglitazone inhibited Ca mobilization, extracellular regulated protein kinase phosphorylation, and insulin secretion stimulated by the Gq-coupled M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Troglitazone and FR900359 inhibited proliferation of MEL92.1 uveal melanoma cells driven by a GNAQ-Q209L driver mutation, but not of SK-MEL-28 cells driven by BRAF-V600E. Together, our study shows that troglitazone may be a promising new lead for the development of a <500 Da small-molecule therapeutic G\u03b1q inhibitor. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Troglitazone, unlike other thiazolidinediones, directly binds and inhibits activity of heterotrimeric G protein Gq, with a weaker effect on Gi. Troglitazone may find usage as a repurposed drug scaffold to build novel small-molecule G\u03b1q inhibitors with better bioavailability than depsipeptide G\u03b1q inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "The BRAF mutation is one of the most common genetic alterations in thyroid tumors, and intrinsic feedback mechanisms have limited the clinical application of BRAF-specific inhibitors. This study aims to investigate the potential biological function of the downstream overexpressed molecule NGEF following the BRAF mutation and its regulatory mechanisms. By integrating data from the CEO database, TCGA database, and clinical samples, we found that NGEF is highly expressed in thyroid cancer and is positively correlated with tumor size, local lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and disease-free survival. Intriguingly, analysis of TCGA data revealed that NGEF expression is significantly higher in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers. Subsequent validation demonstrated that NGEF expression is markedly elevated in BRAF-mutant cancer cell lines and BRAF-engineered cellular models compared to normal cells and BRAF-negative cancer cells. Functional experiments, pathway enrichment analysis, and investigations into phenotype-associated biomarkers further revealed that NGEF promotes invasion and migration of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. To explore the regulatory relationship between the BRAF mutation and NGEF expression, we used bioinformatics tools to predict transcription factors, conducted pathway inhibition experiments, and performed dual-luciferase reporter assays. These studies confirmed that BRAF regulates NGEF expression via the ERK/AP1 pathway. These findings suggest that NGEF enhances the invasive and migratory abilities of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells through BRAF/ERK/AP1 upregulation and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors poses an ongoing clinical challenge. We investigated molecularly matched combination therapies for treatment-refractory GIST, including drugs not previously combined in human studies. METHODS: Patients of all ages with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST treated with combination therapies were included (February 13, 2015-December 31, 2022). These patients were discussed at molecular tumor board and enrolled in the prospective Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (I-PREDICT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02534675). Patient demographics, tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS), treatment responses, and survival outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Six (1.6%) patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 59.5 years with the majority (4/6) of patients being male. NGS revealed median of six deleterious genomic alterations per patient excluding variants of unknown significance. Five (5/6) patients had -mutant GIST, and one patient had -mutant GIST. Two thirds of tumors had  loss. Patients received median of 1 (range, 1-3) customized combination therapy consisting of median of 2 (range, 2-3) drugs targeting median of 2 (range, 2-4) genomic alterations. One patient experienced a treatment-related grade \u22653 adverse event (hypertension). For all patients, the best response by RECIST v1.1 was stable disease (SD). Combination therapies led to SD \u22656 months (range, 6.2-11.3 months) in four (4/6) patients compared with none in the immediate previous single-agent targeted therapies (SD range, 1.5-5.4 months). Most (5/6) patients had at least 60% prolongation of their progression-free survival compared with their immediate previous single-agent targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that a multitargeted, biomarker-matched combination approach can be safely administered to obtain disease control. Tailored combination therapies for advanced GIST with multiple genomic alterations warrant further investigation.",

      "abstract": "On February 16, 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to lifileucel (Amtagvi, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc.) indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with a PD-1 blocking antibody, and if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor. Lifileucel is the first tumor-derived T-cell therapy approved by the FDA. In the pivotal cohort of the phase 2 single-arm, trial, Study C-144-01, that served as the basis for approval, the objective response rate (ORR) among patients treated with lifileucel within FDA-approved dose range (7.5 x 109 - 72 x 109 viable cells, n=73) in the primary efficacy cohort was 31.5% (95% CI: 21.1%-43.4%), including 3 (4.1%) complete responses and 20 (27.4%) partial responses. The median duration of response was not reached (95% CI: 4.1 months-not reached). Among the responders (n=23), 56.5%, 47.8%, and 43.5% maintained durable responses at 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. Among all patients who received lifileucel (N=156), 95.5% of patients experienced at least one Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 87.8% experienced at least one Grade 4 TEAE. Lifileucel labeling includes a Boxed Warning for treatment-related mortality, prolonged severe cytopenia, severe infection, cardiopulmonary impairment, and renal impairment.",

      "abstract": "Targeting the cell cycle has become a focus of cancer research bearing impressive results with the introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, no definitive benefit in other cancers has been observed. In gastrointestinal cancers, despite preclinical studies pinpointing positive effects on cancer inhibition in pre-clinical models, no positive clinical trials have been published with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Several biomarkers have been proposed in breast cancers, where the field is more advanced, and include up-regulations of the inhibited kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and their partner cyclin D as well as the main target of phosphorylation, RB. Up-regulation of Cyclin E, an E2F1/RB regulated gene, also arises as a marker of CDK4/6 inhibition resistance. Signaling from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways through KRAS/BRAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are also implicated in feedback CDK4/6 activation and inhibitors resistance. In gastrointestinal cancers, some of these biomarkers have also proven valuable in predicting sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors and would lead markers to guide clinical development. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment, where immune cells are prominent components, arises as a feature of CDK4/6 inhibition and could be harnessed in therapeutic combinations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene fusions exist with low prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC), and the clinical utility of fusion testing in advanced CRC remains unclear. We sought to identify oncogenic fusions in patients with advanced CRC using a fusion partner-agnostic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay to better understand their clinical relevance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using de-identified data from 18,558 patients with advanced CRC who underwent ctDNA next-generation sequencing with Guardant360 from 2017 to 2022. These samples were subsequently reanalyzed with a partner-agnostic bioinformatics method to identify both clonal and non-clonal fusions. We analyzed for associations between fusions and MSI-H status, as well prior EGFR-directed therapy signature. RESULTS: Fusions were identified in 221 (1.3%) of CRC patients analyzed. 193 patients had 258 activating fusions, while 28 patients had fusions of uncertain significance. Among patients with activating fusions, there were 18 clonal fusions (7%) and 240 (93%) subclonal fusions. Clonal fusions were more common in patients with MSI-H status, and subclonal fusions were associated with prior EGFR exposure signature. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CRC, partner-agnostic ctDNA fusion detection is possible and improves identification as a blood-based approach by extension of fusion calling partners. Detection of fusions in the ctDNA may provide rationale for potential therapeutic strategies according to clonality as informed by the ctDNA, whereas subclonal fusions may play a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF tumors.",

      "abstract": "This review provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular biology and therapeutic advances regarding papillary craniopharyngiomas (PCP), with a particular focus on the pivotal role of the BRAF V600E mutation in its pathogenesis. Histopathologically, PCPs are characterized by stratified squamous epithelium and are frequently associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. This mutation activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which drives tumor development and progression. The identification of this pathway has led to significant progress in targeted therapies, specifically with the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in clinical trials. These inhibitors can effectively reduce tumor size and improve clinical outcomes for patients. However, despite these advancements, there are challenges such as the potential for resistance to these therapies and the management of long-term side effects. Consequently, a multidisciplinary approach that combines surgical resection, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy is often recommended to enhance treatment efficacy although minimizing adverse effects. In addition to adult cases, this review also addresses rare instances of pediatric PCP. Although these cases are infrequent, their molecular characteristics closely resemble those of adult PCP, suggesting that similar therapeutic approaches might be applicable. Looking ahead, future research should focus on optimizing treatment regimens, understanding the interactions within the tumor's immune microenvironment, and identifying novel therapeutic targets. These efforts are crucial for enhancing precision medicine strategies for PCP patients, ultimately improving their quality of life and long-term prognosis. Overall, continued exploration in this field holds promise for more effective and tailored treatment options.",

      "title": "NAMPT and NNMT released via extracellular vesicles and as soluble mediators are distinguished traits of BRAF inhibitor resistance of melanoma cells impacting on the tumor microenvironment.",
      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Drugs targeting mutant BRAF and MEK oncogenes are effective in melanoma, even though resistance rapidly develops. This complex picture includes acquired intrinsic tumor and tumor microenvironmental-mediated mechanisms. Here we show that melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) overexpress the rate-limiting enzymes involved in nicotinamide (NAM) metabolism nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). Remarkably, these cells release NAMPT and NNMT both in the free-form or loaded into extracellular vesicles (EVs). NAMPT is emerging as a key mediator of resistance to BRAFi in melanoma, primarily due to its established role in NAD biosynthesis. Although previously identified as a soluble extracellular factor in this tumor, its presence within EVs released by melanoma cells has not been reported until now, highlighting a previously unrecognized mechanism through which NAMPT may influence the tumor microenvironment (TME). NNMT was revealed to increase in melanoma lesions compared to benign nevi. Here, we report for the first time its overexpression in resistant melanoma cell lines at intracellular and extracellular levels (secreted both as a soluble factor and into EVs). NNMT expression is increased in BRAF-mutated melanoma patients, suggesting a link between its upregulation and the BRAF oncogenic signaling. Moreover, NNMT levels positively correlate with gene signatures associated with pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell migration, and chemokine-mediated pathways. NNMT pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing significantly reduce resistant melanoma cell growth. In addition, we found that BRAFi-resistant cells are more sensitive to NNMT inhibition, highlighting a trait of vulnerability of BRAFi-resistant melanomas. Lastly, we proposed for the first time a tetrameric NNMT:TLR4 binding model offering a plausible structural and mechanistic basis for their association. Our functional results indicated that exogenous NNMT treatment is able to trigger NF-\u03baB pathway, one of the main TLR4-dependent signaling, sharing this cytokine-like properties with NAMPT, and opening a future deeper exploration of its functional role in the extracellular space. Overall, the identification of NAMPT and, surprisingly also NNMT, included in EVs and abundantly released from resistant melanoma cells supports the impact of these moonlighting proteins involved in nicotinamide metabolism as mediators of BRAF/MEK inhibitors resistance with tumor intrinsic and potentially tumor microenvironment-mediated mechanisms. Interfering with nicotinamide metabolism could be a valid strategy to counteract drug resistance acting on the multifactorial tumor-host interactions.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prognostic impact of the BRAF V600E mutation in patients with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is poorly understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective international study included patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC treated with ICI all lines between 2014 and 2023, and available BRAF mutation status. RESULTS: Of 909 patients included, 345 (38\u202f%) had BRAF V600E dMMR/MSI mCRC. In multivariable analysis, BRAFm was not associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ICI start compared to BRAFwt patients (median PFS: 25.0 vs 41.5 months, adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR)=\u202f0.97, p\u202f=\u202f0.8 and OS: 55.1 months vs not reached adjHR=\u202f0.98, p\u202f=\u202f0.9). However, in patients treated with ICI in first line, the rate of secondary resistance, defined as the progression after the first 6 months of treatment, was higher in BRAFm patients (20\u202f% vs 11\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In patients with disease control for 6 months in 1st line, the PFS and OS from this point onwards were significantly shorter in BRAFm patients (adjHR for PFS 2.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.03 and adjHR for OS 2.80, p\u202f=\u202f0.019). The poor prognostic value of the BRAF mutation was no longer observed in patients treated with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dMMR/MSI mCRC, the BRAF V600E mutation is not associated with a shorter PFS/OS on ICI treatment in the overall population across all lines. However, specifically in patients treated in the first-line setting, our results suggest that the BRAF mutation is associated with a higher rate of secondary resistance, suggesting that a combination of PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors upfront may be of particular interest in these patients.",

      "abstract": "A new group of thiadiazole-benzenesulfonamide hybrids was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as potential dual inhibitors targeting B-Raf and VEGFR-2 for cancer therapy. The cytotoxic activity of the synthesized derivatives was assessed against HepG2 and Huh7 liver cancer cell lines, where compound 7a exhibited the most potent activity with IC values of 17.89\u2009\u03bcM and 25.07\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. The kinase inhibition assay revealed that 7a strongly inhibited both B-Raf (IC\u2009=\u20090.11\u2009\u03bcM) and VEGFR-2 (IC\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009\u03bcM), surpassing sorafenib in B-Raf inhibition. Further mechanistic studies revealed that 7a induced G2/M phase arrest, with a significant increase in late apoptotic cells (57.08%) compared to the control group (0.15%), confirming its pro-apoptotic effect. The apoptotic pathway was further validated by caspase-3 activation, Bax upregulation, and Bcl-2 downregulation. Computational analyses verified the effective binding of compound 7a to VEGFR-2. These analyses included molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA), protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (ProLIF), principal component analysis (PCAT), and free energy landscape (FEL) studies. Additionally, DFT studies indicated 7a's stability and reactivity. In silico ADMET predictions indicated that the derivatives had good absorption, were non-mutagenic, non-carcinogenic, and exhibited low toxicity risks compared to sorafenib. These findings suggest that the synthesized thiadiazole-benzenesulfonamide hybrids, particularly 7a, represent promising dual BRAF/VEGFR-2 inhibitors with potent anti-cancer activity, warranting further optimization and preclinical evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Drug resistance critically limits the long-term efficacy of MAPK-targeted therapy in melanoma. While resistance mechanisms at genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional scales are well-documented, post-transcriptional splicing regulation remains poorly understood. By analyzing patient-matched pre-treatment and resistant melanoma biopsies, we uncover widespread alternative splicing alterations during therapy resistance. Splicing perturbations are most pronounced in MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathway genes. We identify a splicing switch of AKT2 from isoform 210 to 206 in 29.55% (13/44) of disease-progressive biopsies. This splicing switch induces AKT2 kinase hyperactivity by restoring the activated fragment A-loop. Functional validations confirm that AKT2-206 confers BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma cells by activating S6 kinase. Further, the splicing factor hnRNPK likely drives the splicing switch of AKT2 during acquired resistance. Our results not only provide insights into splicing-mediated regulation of drug resistance but also highlight the importance of alternative splicing isoforms as targets for clinical diagnosis and therapy.",
