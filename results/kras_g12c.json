      "abstract": "Lung cancer is a highly diverse disease, and reliable preclinical models that accurately reflect tumor characteristics are essential for studying lung cancer biology and testing new therapies. This study aimed to establish patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) using small biopsy samples and surgical specimens to create a model system that preserves the genetic and histological features of the original tumors.  PDTOs were generated from 163 lung cancer specimens, including 109 samples obtained using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) or bronchoscopy, 52 surgical specimens, and 2 pleural fluid samples. The organoid establishment rate beyond passage three was assessed, and histological subtypes and genetic profiles were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining and targeted exome sequencing.  The overall PDTO establishment rate was 34.4% (56/163), and 44.6% (25/56) of these organoids retained the histological and genetic features of the parental tumors. Genetic analysis identified key mutations, including KRAS G12C, EGFR L858R, MET exon 14 skipping mutation, and ROS1 fusion. PDTOs successfully formed tumors in mice while maintaining the genetic characteristics of the original tumors. Co-culture of PDTOs with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) resulted in increased resistance to paclitaxel. In the co-culture model of PDTOs with immune cells, dose-dependent growth inhibition of PDTOs was observed in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  PDTOs established from small biopsy and surgical specimens serve as a valuable model for studying lung cancer biology, tumor microenvironment interactions, and drug response. This model has the potential to improve personalized treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype with poor prognosis. Outcomes to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and genomic features in PSC remain underexplored compared to other NSCLC subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from three institutions and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) with metastatic NSCLC treated with ICI alone or with chemotherapy were identified. Clinicogenomics and treatment outcomes were compared across PSC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). RESULTS: We analyzed 4,841 patients including 165 PSC cases treated with ICI-based therapy from three institutions, and 201 PSC from NCDB. In MDACC, 65 (4.3%) were PSC, 1,138 (75.1%) LUAD, and 312 (20.6%) LUSC. PSC patients were older and more likely to present with metastatic disease. In both the MDACC and NCDB cohorts, ICIs resulted in better outcomes for PSC patients compared with chemotherapy. In these patients, there was no difference in outcome between ICI-monotherapy and ICI-chemotherapy. Across the three institutional cohorts, 37%-43% of patients with PSC who received ICIs were responders, compared to 26%-29% in LUAD and 22%-46% in LUSC (P < 0.05). Improved ICI outcomes in PSC appeared driven by high PD-L1 (\u226550% in 73%-77% cases). Among patients with high PD-L1, response rates were similar across histologic subtypes. Conversely, TMB was similar in PSC compared to LUAD/LUSC, and was not associated with ICI outcomes. Across cohorts, PSC tumors were enriched for TP53, NF1, NF2, and NRAS, with relative depletion of STK11 and KEAP1 compared to LUAD. Case observation showed relatively better outcomes to ICI than targeted therapies in PSC patients with MET exon 14 skipping or KRAS G12C. CONCLUSION: PSC exhibits improved outcomes to ICI relative to other therapies, potentially driven by high PD-L1 expression. Genomic analysis highlights a distinct genomic landscape of PSC when compared with LUAD.",

      "abstract": "IBI351 (also known as fulzerasib or GFH925), an irreversible covalent inhibitor of KRAS, has demonstrated promising anti-tumour activity in patients with solid tumours. In this study, data were pooled from the phase I part of two clinical studies (NCT05005234 and NCT05497336), aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IBI351 monotherapy in KRAS inhibitor-na\u00efve Chinese patients with KRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). As of December 13, 2023, 56 patients treated with IBI351 monotherapy were included. The median duration of treatment was 7.7 months (range: 0.3-16.7). The confirmed ORR was 44.6% (95% CI: 31.3-58.5), with a DCR of 87.5% (95% CI: 75.9-94.8). With a median follow-up of 13.8 months, the median PFS was 8.1 months (95% CI: 5.5-13.8). The median OS was 17.0 months (95% CI: 12.6-not reached). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 53 patients (94.6%), with grade 3 TRAEs in 14 patients (25.0%). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. The most common grade 3 TRAEs were anaemia (n\u2009=\u20094, 7.1%) and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (n\u2009=\u20093, 5.4%). TRAEs led to dose interruption in 12 patients (21.4%) and dose reduction in six patients (10.7%). No TRAEs resulted in treatment discontinuation. IBI351 demonstrated encouraging clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile in KRAS inhibitor-na\u00efve Chinese patients with KRAS-mutated metastatic CRC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncolytic virus (OV)-mediated immunotherapy has been shown limited efficacy. Small molecule inhibitors specific to the KRAS driver oncoprotein have recently been developed for cancer treatment. The combination of a potent OV with a KRAS inhibitor could be a potent combination strategy for treating KRAS cancer. METHODS: We explored combination therapies using KRAS inhibitor and OV in cancer cells in vitro and in two KRAS cancer models. We employed flow cytometry to evaluate the immune cell profiles, including dendritic cells, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, natural killer (NK), subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3), activation markers (granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB) as well as enzyme-linked immunospot assay to identify tumor-antigen specific T cells. The importance of CD4, CD8 T and NK cells in the therapeutic effects was evaluated by antibody-mediated depletion in vivo. RESULTS: We confirmed that three inhibitors for KRAS, AMG510 (sotorasib), MRTX849 (adagrasib) and MRTX1257, all displayed potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells harboring KRAS, but not to cancer cells without this specific KRAS mutation in vitro. All three inhibitors exhibited potent antitumor activity in KRAS Lewis lung cancer, but not in MC38 colon cancer with wild-type KRAS. In two KRAS tumor models, either an IL-36\u03b3-armed OV or orally delivered MRTX1257 inhibited tumor growth, but the combination worked much more efficiently, and efficacy was further improved with PD-1 blockade although with no statistical difference in survival, leading to complete tumor remission in a large fraction of the mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that MRTX1257, and other KRAS inhibitors as well, are potent inducers of antitumor immunity by themselves, and that it worked with OV to elicit potent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immunity. The combination therapeutic efficacy depended largely on increased tumor-specific CD8 cytotoxic T cells, and to a smaller degree, on CD4 T and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Small molecule inhibitors of KRAS are novel inducers of tumor-specific immunity, and a unique triple combination regimen is highly efficacious through elicited potent antitumor immunity for KRAS cancers.",

In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of SOS1 inhibitors based on the 5,8-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one scaffold. Biological evaluation revealed that most compounds displayed anti-proliferative activity against K562 leukemia cells.

A15f and B5a exhibited inhibitory activity against KRAS-G12C/SOS1 complex formation, with IC\u2085\u2080 value of 40.28 and 11.11\u00a0nM respectively and led to a dose-dependent decrease in pERK levels. The combination therapy of KRAS G12C inhibitor and A15f shows enhanced in vitro efficacy. Molecular docking revealed that these two compounds shared a conserved binding mode with SOS1, similar to the reported inhibitors. These findings provide foundation for further development of SOS1-targeted anticancer therapeutics and offer valuable insights for structural optimization of this novel class of inhibitors.",

Oral small molecule inhibitors, including sotorasib and adagrasib, have demonstrated moderate efficacy in targeting KRAS G12C in NSCLC. More potent inhibitors are needed, and the landscape is rapidly evolving. AREAS COVERED: Opnurasib (JDQ-443) is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of GDP-bound KRAS G12C that has been under investigation in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors, including NSCLC. Here, we review its mechanism of action, pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy, role within the NSCLC landscape prior to its withdrawal from the market, as well as the regulatory and market-driven dynamics that may result in the abandonment of aspiring drugs. EXPERT OPINION: JDQ-443's unique binding within the Switch II pocket of KRAS G12C allows for novel interactions and helps define its characteristic profile of anti-tumor activity, tolerability, and resistance. JDQ-443\u00a0has demonstrated promising early clinical activity in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. More data is necessary to allow comparison of available agents and combination strategies. In the face of an expanding market, development of JDQ-443\u00a0has been halted despite promising safety and efficacy outcomes and ongoing innovative trials, highlighting critical challenges in the drug development process. The existing body of work characterizing JDQ-443 remains extremely informative.",

When RAS genes undergo mutations or abnormal expression, they can become oncogenic drivers, and the oncogenic mechanism of KRAS mutations which drive cancer progression is highly complex. Colorectal cancer carrying KRAS mutation genes often exhibits poor prognosis. Despite the advent of KRAS G12C inhibitors, monotherapy demonstrates suboptimal clinical efficacy in colorectal cancer, which is attributed to primary resistance and limited coverage of prevalent KRAS mutations (such as G12D and G12V).

Genomic studies have demonstrated that SBT and LGSC frequently harbor mutations in members of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway, which can be targeted therapeutically. LGSC harbor mutations in KRAS (up to 54\u00a0%, primarily non-G12C mutations), NRAS, and BRAF. Treatment of recurrent LGSC with the MEK inhibitor trametinib demonstrated improved clinical outcomes relative to other treatment options (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) in a phase 3 trial. Other MEK inhibitors have also shown efficacy in LGSC, with some studies demonstrating higher response rates in patients whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations. However, some trials of MEK inhibitors showed more limited benefit (e.g. binimetinib), and RAS pathway mutations do not always correlate with increased efficacy, highlighting the need for further clinical and translational research in RAS-MEK-ERK pathway targeted therapeutics. Current clinical trials are evaluating MEK inhibitor combinations such as MEK inhibitors plus inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), AKT, PI3K, CDK4/6, or BCL2/BCL-XL. Novel approaches to targeting the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway include the RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib, which has been evaluated in combination with the FAK inhibitor defactinib, and this combination received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval in 2025. Multiple newly developed inhibitors of KRAS, including KRAS G12C or G12D inhibitors, as well as pan-RAS inhibitors, including RAS (ON) inhibitors such as RMC-6236, are being evaluated in solid tumors. These emerging strategies for inhibiting RAS-MEK-ERK pathway activity may offer new treatment options for patients with LGSC.",

For this purpose, we compare RNAseq data of different responsive KRAS-mutant cell lines, H358 and HCC44, to illustrate distinct resistance scenarios against a KRAS-inhibitor. We apply the following steps to investigate this: (I) Analysis of variance shows several differentially expressed marker genes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and confirms HCC44 cells to be more aggressive. (II) Protein network analysis of key players of resistance reveals upregulation of Dachshund homolog 1 (DACH1) only in treated H358 cells. (III) A systematic analysis of NSCLC with a semi-quantitative signaling network predicts several protein targets counter-acting the KRAS-mutation, including DACH1. (IV) We show correlations between the expression level of these genes and resulting survival outcomes using TCGA data from patients. (V) We validate key signature genes by quantitative PCR in H358 cells. Our study identifies DACH1 as marker for resistance from RNAseq data of a 3D tissue NSCLC model validated with patient survival data.

We present a 63-year-old male patient with stage IVa (cT4N3M1b) lung ASC. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed co-occurring mutations in KRAS G12C, BRAF (non-V600E), PIK3CA, and FLT1. Biomarker analysis showed: PD-L1 expression of 18.11% (Tumor Proportion Score, TPS), a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 3.7 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb), and microsatellite instability (MSI) classified as low (MSI-L) with an instability rate of 35.29%. As first-line treatment, the patient received six cycles of tislelizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) combined with chemotherapy, followed by tislelizumab maintenance therapy for two years. The patient maintained sustained complete response (CR) with progression-free survival (PFS) reaching 46.5 months, significantly exceeding the typical median PFS of 8-12 months in advanced NSCLC populations. To our knowledge, this presents the first reported case of advanced pulmonary ASC harboring co-occurring driver mutations that demonstrated a remarkable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Our case highlights the critical role of comprehensive molecular profiling and rational combination strategies in managing rare lung cancer subtypes, establishing a potential treatment paradigm for genomically similar cases.",

      "abstract": "Over 100 co-crystal structures of KRAS switch-II pocket (SII-P) targeting inhibitors are currently available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank. These publicly available structures are invaluable tools that have led to a more in-depth understanding of KRAS SII-P pocket, which is crucial for targeted drug design efforts. The binding modes (co-crystal structures) of two KRAS(G12C) inhibitors that have advanced to the clinical trials, GDC-6036 (divarasib) and LY3537982 (olomorasib), are currently unavailable. Here, we reveal the putative binding modes of these two G12C inhibitors by utilizing the available structural data of analogous compounds and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (total simulation time of 200\u00a0micros). Our biochemical assays confirm high affinity of both inhibitors for KRAS(G12C), with differential susceptibility to typical resistance associated co-mutations. A co-mutation at Tyr96 reduces the affinity of both inhibitors, whereas a mutation at His95 negatively impacts only GDC-6036. While both inhibitors display low activity towards KRAS(WT), LY3537982 maintains high activity against other RAS isoforms with G12C mutation. As the simulation predictions align with the experimental results, our findings indicate that microsecond timescale simulations can be a valuable tool for predicting binding modes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: KRAS is one of the most commonly occurring mutated oncogene in human cancers. Development of KRAS G12C or G12D inhibitors exhibit promising clinical activities, but patients harboring other hotspot KRAS mutations cannot benefit from those strategies. Recent development in pan-RAS inhibitors have broad therapeutic implications and merit clinical investigation. However, intrinsic and acquired drug resistance caused by tumor heterogeneity greatly limit the clinical application, posing a significant challenge in this field. RESULTS: In this study, through CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA screening using a human kinome sgRNA library, EGFR was discovered to correlate with the sensitivity of KRAS-mutated tumors to pan-RAS inhibitor RMC-7977. Through multiple in vitro cell proliferation or viability assays, EGFR loss or pharmacological EGFR inhibition significantly enhances the effectiveness of pan-RAS inhibitors in multiple KRAS or KRAS cancer cell lines, disregarding their cellular origins. Mechanistically, co-inhibition of EGFR and pan-RAS may further dampen the RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway activation than either alone, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor activity of pan-RAS inhibitors. Strikingly, with the LL/2 syngeneic mice tumor model, the combination of pan-RAS inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors demonstrated more significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy compared to either single agent. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study employed high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA screening to identify the enhanced anti-cancer effects when combining EGFR inhibitors with pan-RAS inhibitors in multiple human KRAS-mutated cancer cell lines as well as a mouse syngeneic tumor model. This synergy underscores the potential for a combinational therapy strategy, leveraging EGFR and pan-RAS inhibitors to improve treatment outcomes for patients with KRAS-driven cancers.",

Based on X-ray crystallographic insights and quantum chemical calculations, we herein describe the elucidation of structure-activity and -stability correlations to advance such electrophiles for drug discovery. Guided by predictions of transition state barrier heights for the attack of aspartate 12 at the \u03b2-lactone electrophile and structure-based design, we generated substituted \u03b2-lactones aiming to balance specific reactivity and chemical and metabolic stability. Our optimization strategy is driven by MS-based and cellular covalent target occupancy assays and PD marker analysis, proteome-wide profiling, and synthetic chemistry.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Clinical trials are assessing the suitability of KRAS inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting. Appropriate patient selection is paramount to ensure therapeutic efficacy. Here we sought to investigate the clinical utility of ctDNA to identify resectable lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with KRAS-driven disease. MATERIALS & PATIENTS: From our institution's clinical database and biobank, we identified 47 patients based on our inclusion criteria: research-consented, treatment-na\u00efve, NGS-confirmed KRAS-mutated resectable stage IA-IIIB LUAD with available pre-operative blood. cfDNA was isolated from 700-2000\u00b5L plasma and was preamplified. In a tumour-informed approach, digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was performed to identify hotspot KRAS & KRAS ctDNA and wild-type KRAS cfDNA in the same reaction based on prior tumor tissue profiling. RESULTS: In overall clinical staging, KRAS ctDNA was detected in liquid biopsies of stage II (1/7, 14%) and III (2/5, 40%) patients. In overall pathological staging, KRAS ctDNA was detected exclusively in liquid biopsies of stage III patients (4/11, 36%). KRAS ctDNA was detected in liquid biopsies of overall clinical stage I (1/3, 33%) and III (1/1, 100%) patients and in pathological stage II (1/3, 33%) and III (1/2, 50%) patients. KRAS ctDNA positivity was associated with shorter overall survival (median OS 21 months vs. 41 months, P < .05). KRAS ctDNA positivity was associated with larger tumour size, presence of nodal involvement, and higher overall pathological stage. CONCLUSION: ctDNA positivity from liquid biopsy is a low-cost and accessible method for triaging patients with LUAD towards trials evaluating KRAS inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting.",

The primary objective was safety, and the other objectives included preliminary antitumor activity. Overall, 65 patients with advanced -positive NSCLC received single-agent oral divarasib 50-400 mg once daily and 31 patients (48%) were treated beyond 1 year. Divarasib continued to be well tolerated, and the safety profile beyond 1 year was consistent with the overall safety profile. In patients with measurable disease at baseline across all dose levels (n = 63), the confirmed objective response rate was 55.6% (95% CI, 42.5 to 68.1), and the median duration of response was 18.0 months (95% CI, 11.1 to 24.9).

      "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations of Ras are among the most common genetic alterations in human cancer, with an estimated disease burden of >3 million new patients per year worldwide. Despite widespread appreciation of the importance of Ras in cancer, direct binding ligands, which block downstream signaling, were not reported until 2013 due to the lack of obvious drug binding pockets in the protein. The clinically approved K-Ras inhibitors are mutant-selective as they rely on covalent recognition of the highly nucleophilic somatic cysteine residue of K-Ras(G12C). Recent preclinical reports of noncovalent K-Ras binding inhibitors have emerged, which lack mutant specificity and exhibit varying degrees of biochemical preference for mutant K-Ras over the wild-type. An adjacent glycine-13 mutation, p. G13C, particularly abundant in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer, has not been targeted with an approved therapeutic molecule. Here, we report a series of targeted electrophiles designed to covalently modify Cys13 in K-Ras(G13C), overcoming the structural challenge posed by its shifted position relative to Cys12 in K-Ras(G12C). These inhibitors effectively alkylate K-Ras(G13C) in both GDP- and GTP-bound states, block effector interactions, and suppress the growth of K-Ras(G13C)-mutation cancer cell lines. Our findings expand the landscape of covalent K-Ras inhibitors beyond G12 mutations, providing a new therapeutic strategy for K-Ras(G13C)-driven cancers.",
