      "title": "Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate Alleviates Alectinib-Induced Hepatotoxicity by Inhibiting Mitochondrial Damage-Mediated Pyroptosis.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alectinib is a widely used first-line ALK inhibitor for fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity, and its mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate how alectinib induces liver injury and to explore a potential protective strategy. METHODS: In vitro, AML-12\u00a0hepatocytes were incubated with alectinib to determine cell viability and morphology by using CCK-8 assay and optical microscopy, respectively. Necrosis was assessed by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Mitochondrial damage was analyzed by measuring membrane potential, ultrastructure, and respiratory chain complex activities using JC-1 staining under fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and assay kits, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using DCFH-DA staining and flow cytometry. Pyroptosis- and oxidative stress-related proteins (NLRP3, GSDMD-N, P20, cleaved IL-1\u03b2, Nrf2, HO-1) were quantified by Western blot. In vivo, C57BL/6J mice were divided into control, alectinib treatment, and alectinib plus magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) treatment groups. Serum ALT and AST were measured to assess liver function. Hepatic oxidative stress was evaluated by SOD and MDA levels. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by corresponding kits. Liver histopathology was examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: We found alectinib could induce the death of AML-12\u00a0hepatocytes. Alectinib impaired both the function and structure of mitochondria and caused a significant increase in ROS levels. The excessive accumulation of ROS triggered oxidative stress and finally resulted in cell pyroptosis in AML-12 cells. MgIG was found to alleviate mitochondrial damage and reduce ROS levels, restore the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress and pyroptosis caused by alectinib. CONCLUSION: Alectinib induces elevated ROS levels in hepatocytes by damaging mitochondria and causing oxidative stress in hepatocytes, which results in cell pyroptosis and ultimately hepatotoxicity, whereas MgIG can treat alectinib-induced hepatic injury by restoring mitochondrial function and structure.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder with symptoms often appearing during childhood. Current approved long-term prophylaxis (LTP) for children aged <12 years require parenteral administration. Berotralstat is an oral, small-molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor, approved as prophylaxis of HAE attacks in patients aged \u226512 years. OBJECTIVE: APeX-P (NCT05453968), the largest trial of LTP in patients with HAE aged 2 to <12 years, evaluated oral berotralstat for the LTP of HAE in pediatric patients. METHODS: Before berotralstat initiation, patients received standard of care (SOC) for 12 weeks. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of berotralstat were assessed in a planned interim analysis. RESULTS: Median (range) age of patients (N=29) was 8.0 (3, 11) years, with 48.3% female. Median age at symptom onset was 2.0 years, and 82.8% of patients reported symptom onset before 6 years. Steady-state berotralstat median (range) Tmax was 3.9 hrs (0.9, 6.0) and geometric mean (coefficient of variation) Cmax was 204 ng/mL (40%) and AUC0-last was 915 ng\u2022hr/mL (42%). Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. There were no drug-related Grade 3/4 or serious AEs, deaths, or discontinuations related to AEs. Median (range) HAE attack rate during SOC was 0.96 (0, 5.0) attacks per 4-week period. Median (range) HAE attack rates for each 4-week period from Day 1 to Week 48 were 0 (Week 4: 0, 4.0; Week 48: 0, 1.7). CONCLUSION: Oral berotralstat was well tolerated and resulted in early and sustained reductions in HAE attack rates.",

      "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements have been identified as oncogenic drivers of multiple malignancies. Although at least three generations of ALK inhibitors have been developed, the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations remains a major barrier to drug efficacy. In this study, we develop a multiscale computational pipeline that combines hotspot residue identification, saturation mutagenesis screening, and alchemical free energy calculations to predict the impact of point mutations on the binding affinity of fourth-generation ALK inhibitors NVL-655 and TPX-0131. The hotspot residue analysis reveals that L1122, V1130, V1180, L1196, L1198, M1199, D1203, and L1256 contribute the most to ligand binding. A total of 9 and 13 mutations are identified as drug-resistant candidates with significantly decreased binding free energy of over 3\u202fkcal/mol for NVL-655 and TPX-0131, respectively. Specifically, V1180W, M1199W, and L1256S are the common mutations with decreased binding free energy concerning both inhibitors. These findings highlight important residues and mutations that may impact the clinical efficacy of NVL-655 and TPX-0131, and this pipeline provides an efficient and accurate framework to predict drug-resistant mutations and facilitate the rational design of next-generation ALK inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib, a third-generation Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), has demonstrated excellent curative effect in clinical studies to overcome mutations resistant to first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. It also has improved blood-brain barrier crossing and reduced brain metastases. METHODS: 44 patients were selected who received Lorlatinib as initial treatment for first-diagnosis ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or who received Lorlatinib as a back-line treatment after developing resistance with first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. The primary study endpoints are objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: For the 44 patients, the overall ORR[95% confidence intervals (CI)]was 59% (95% CI: 51-69), the DCR was 93% (95% CI: 36-56). In the first-line treatment group(n\u2009=\u200915), lorlatinib showned an ORR 93% (95% CI: 52-81), and the DCR was 100% (95% CI: 47-78). Additionally, 29 patients who received sequential Lorlatinib after progression on at least one first- or second-generation ALK-TKI showned an ORR of 41% (95% CI: 41-63) and a DCR of 90% (95% CI: 20-40). Lorlatinib demonstrated strong intracranial efficacay, with an overall intracranial objective response rate (IC-ORR) of 74% (95% CI: 67-92) and an intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) of 96% (95% CI: 53-81) in 23 patients with brain metastase. Among them, the IC-ORR and IC-DCR of 7 patients who received Lorlatinib as first-line therapy were both 100% (95% CI: 89-103). For 16 patients who had received at least one ALK-TKI, the IC-ORR with Lorlatinib was 63% (95% CI: 51-90), and the IC-DCR was 94% (95% CI: 27-70). 44 patients treated with Lorlatinib, all at a starting dose of 100\u00a0mg/day, 77% experienced adverse events, with the most common associated adverse event being hyperlipidaemia, However the overall grading was mild to moderate, with only one case of a reduction in dosage to 75\u00a0mg. CONCLUSIONS: This real-world evidence demonstrates that Lorlatinib exhibits significant clinical efficacy and intracranial anti-tumor activity in the treatment of ALK\u2009+\u2009NSCLC patients, whether in first-line or post-first-line treatment, while being well tolerated.",

      "abstract": "Protein hydrolysis-targeted chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional molecules designed for the selective degradation of target proteins. MS4078, a novel PROTAC, shows promise for treating ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet its clinical efficacy is hindered by suboptimal tumor targeting and off-target toxicities. To enhance its therapeutic profile, we developed human heavy chain ferritin (HFN) as a targeted delivery system, leading to the creation of HFN@MS4078 nanocages. Prepared via passive loading, HFN@MS4078 achieved a drug loading capacity of 178 molecules per nanocage with a HFN recovery rate of 70.1\u202f%. The nanocages exhibited a rapid release profile under lysosomal conditions (pH 5.0), with approximately 80\u202f% drug release after 60\u202fh, while maintaining over 80\u202f% stability at physiological pH 7.4. In vitro, HFN@MS4078 was actively internalized into lysosomes via TfR1 receptor binding, resulting in a 2.7-2.8 times reduction in IC values compared to free MS4078. Furthermore, HFN@MS4078 significantly decreased the expression levels of ALK, p-ALK, p-AKT, and p-ERK in NCI-H2228 and NCI-H3122 cell lines. In vivo, HFN@MS4078 substantially reduced tumor volume and prolonged survival while exhibiting negligible systemic toxicity. These results suggest that HFN@MS4078 represents a promising strategy for targeted therapy in ALK-positive NSCLC, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Brigatinib and alectinib are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) approved in China in 2022 and 2018, respectively, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive, advanced non\u2011small\u2011cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study is to conduct a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of first-line drugs, brigatinib and alectinib, in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states was used to simulate the health outcomes and costs of brigatinib and alectinib with a 30-year time horizon. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) data were used to obtain the comparative efficacy of brigatinib and alectinib, owing to lack of head-to-head trials. As the health benefits were comparable between brigatinib and alectinib on the basis of the ITCs, cost-minimization analysis (CMA) was conducted. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) were also conducted as scenario analyses using the different point estimates from the ITCs. Health state utilities and costs were obtained from public sources or clinical expert opinion. Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for the CMA. RESULTS: The CMA showed that, over 30\u00a0years, brigatinib (63,539 USD) was associated with cost savings of 14,203 USD compared with alectinib (77,742 USD). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that drug costs were the most influential parameter but brigatinib remained cost-saving in all the analyses. In the CEAs, the total cost of brigatinib was lower in all scenarios and also resulted in higher QALYs in 60% of the CEA scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Brigatinib was a cost-saving (14,203 USD) treatment compared with alectinib in the CMA analysis for the first-line treatment of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in China.",

Through the introduction of a hexamerization-enhancing mutation in the IgG Fc domain, HexaBody-CD27 was designed to drive clustering and activation of CD27 via intermolecular Fc:Fc interactions between membrane-bound antibodies, independent of crosslinking by Fc\u03b3R-bearing cells. HexaBody-CD27 carries an Fc-silencing mutation to prevent T-cell depletion through Fc-mediated effector functions.\u00a0In vitro, HexaBody-CD27 induced CD27 receptor signaling independent of Fc\u03b3R-mediated crosslinking in a reporter assay. It also enhanced T-cell proliferation, cytotoxic activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in primary human lymphocytes. In contrast to benchmark IgG1 CD27 antibodies, HexaBody-CD27 did not induce phagocytosis of T cells in vitro. HexaBody-CD27 promoted ex vivo tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) expansion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, in particular of CD8 TILs. The combination of HexaBody-CD27 with an anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced T-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity in vitro compared to either compound alone. In conclusion, HexaBody-CD27 enhanced T-cell activation and effector functions in an Fc\u03b3R-crosslinking-independent manner, without inducing T-cell depletion. The immune agonist activity of HexaBody-CD27 was potentiated in combination with PD-1 blockade.",

      "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor of the RTK insulin superfamily, was named after its initial identification in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Following a reciprocal chromosomal translocation with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), ALK protein is abnormally expressed, promoting the malignant transformation of T cells into a more aggressive lymphoma. The inhibition of ALK activity could therefore benefit ALK+ ALCL patients. Despite the market availability and success of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), real-world ALK+ ALCL patients exhibit significant heterogeneity in terms of disease stage at first diagnosis, tumor progression, and responses to medication. This indicates a need for more detailed differentiation of ALK+ ALCL patients in clinical practice. Here, we discovered that apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-reduction/oxidation factor 1 (APE1/REF1), an interacting partner of NPM1, could stabilize NPM1-ALK fusion protein oligomers and enhance ALK tumor-promoting activity and growth, decreasing cell sensitivity to ALK-TKIs. Our results also reveal that disruption of the interaction weakens cell growth and augments the therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib and alectinib, ALK-TKIs, against ALK+ ALCL. Thus, high expression of APE1 indicates a faster growth of ALK+ ALCL; targeting this interaction may potentially achieve improved therapeutic outcomes, providing a reference for more precise treatment of ALK+ ALCL patients in clinical practice.",

We identified a rare case of ALK-positive histiocytosis with fusion of the ALK gene with TFG. A 35-year-old previously healthy male has been complaining of back and hip discomfort for seven months. A radiologic examination of the spine and pelvis revealed several hypermetabolic osteolytic lesions. Immunostaining for LCA, CD68, CD117and ALK were positive, whereas immunostaining for CD1a, Langerin, and S100 were negative. Analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the ALK rearrangements, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed the fusion of the TFG and ALK genes. After receiving alectinib, an ALK inhibitor of the second generation, the patient showed a durable remission. ALK-positive histiocytosis is a distinct form of histiocytosis that has the potential to be treated with an ALK inhibitor.",

      "abstract": "In total, >90 unique anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement fusion partners have been identified, each with a unique sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, rendering targeted therapy challenging. In the present study, the efficacy of alectinib in a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harbouring a novel ALK-microtubule-associated tumour suppressor candidate 2 (MTUS2) fusion and a rare Striatin 3 (STRN3)-ALK fusion was assessed. A 20-year-old non-smoker was hospitalised with a persistent cough. Subsequent positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed a tumour in the right lower lobe, with mediastinal, hilar, lymph node and bone metastases. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging also revealed a cerebral metastasis. Bronchoscopic biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe nodule, resulting in a clinical stage IVB diagnosis (cT2bN3bM1c). Targeted next-generation sequencing of tissue and blood samples revealed ALK-MTUS2 and STRN3-ALK fusions. The patient was treated with alectinib as the first-line therapy and a durable partial response was achieved after 3 months, with disappearance of the brain metastases. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first discovery of simultaneous ALK-MTUS2 and STRN3-ALK fusions. The clinical outcome offers potential therapeutic options for patients with rare ALK rearrangements and underscores the necessity for further research on the functions of these fusions.",

In pediatric patients, the majority of cases are Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-positive. Despite intensive multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, treatment failure rates remain at 25-30%. Recent advancements in targeted therapies, notably ALK inhibitors and the anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin, have demonstrated substantial activity in relapsed and refractory settings. Molecular detection of minimal disseminated disease (MDD) and minimal residual disease (MRD) offer improved prognostic stratification. For patients with relapsed or refractory disease, targeted therapies have increased treatment options, but more work needs to be done to define optimal treatment regimens, duration, and need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in this group. Immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy provide additional therapeutic options. Incorporating targeted therapies and MDD/MRD assessments into clinical trials could significantly improve outcomes for pediatric and adolescent patients with ALCL.",

These attacks may involve immune and inflammatory mechanisms. We compared serum biomarkers indicating vascular integrity, leakage, angiogenesis, coagulation, and inflammation. During an attack-free period, we assessed 34 markers simultaneously using multi- and/or singleplex ELISA in 25 patients with C1-INH-HAE, 17 with ACEi-AE, 25 with Hist-AE, and 23 healthy controls. Differential blood counts, C1-INH-HAE-specific laboratory parameters, and recently developed assays addressing early complement and lectin pathways were included. The results revealed significant differences, as well as some similarities. Tie-2, VEGFs, C1s/C1INHc appear to play a role in all AE types regardless of whether they are bradykinin- or histamine-mediated. Furthermore, evidence was found for a role of IL-17, eosinophil, and neutrophil chemotactic factors, and the activation of these granulocytes was found. MASP-1/C1-INHc indicated early activation of the lectin pathway in ACEi-AE and HistAE, but not in C1-INH-HAE. C1s/C1-INHc and MASP-1/C1INHc ratio was able to discriminate C1-INH-HAE from controls and the other AE types. Future investigations in C1-INH-HAE, ACEi-AE, and Hist-AE should not only focus on complement activation but also the interaction with granulocytes.",

      "abstract": "The study investigated the potential of nano-formulated orientin (NF-O) in the anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. Orientin is a flavonoid that has a promising effect against anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-arrhythmia properties. Nano-formulation aimed to overcome this limitation and also served to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. In silico docking studies, the favorable binding of orientin was identified with the key oncogenic targets (EGFR, ALK, KRAS, NTRK). After nano-formulation, UV spectroscopy confirmed the integrity of orientin with no shift in the \u03bbmax (347\u2009nm). Dynamic light scattering showed a significant reduction in the improved particle size (PDI decreased from 0.863 to 0.173) by nano-formulation from 559\u2009nm to 220\u2009nm. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed that the nano-formulation process did not alter the chemical structure of orientin. In-vitro studies using MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed that NF-O inhibited cell growth and reduced viability in a dose-dependent manner. At 10 \u00b5M, NF-O significantly inhibited the cell growth and migration compared to the control and native orientin in wound healing assays (p\u2009<\u20090.01). In ova, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, NF-O (10 \u00b5g/ml) significantly inhibited angiogenesis by reducing blood vessel density, branching, length, and network formation compared to controls and native orientin. These findings suggest that NF-O holds significant promise as a novel anti-angiogenic agent for the cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK-rearrangement. Ceritinib, a clinically approved ALK inhibitor, is associated with some adverse reactions, including organizing pneumonia (OP). However, few cases of ceritinib-induced OP have been reported to date. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old female patient with ALK\u2009+\u2009lung adenocarcinoma presented with paroxysmal cough lasting 3\u00a0months. Antibiotic therapy was not effective, and blood and sputum cultures were negative. DIAGNOSIS: A computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of the left upper lung was performed and hematoxylin-eosin staining was consistent with OP. The diagnosis of ceritinib-induced OP was considered based on these results. INTERVENTIONS: Ceritinib was then stopped, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone (40\u00a0mg ivgtt qd) for one week. The dose was lowered to 32\u00a0mg po qd with regular follow-up. Later, the patient switched to another ALK inhibitor, ensartinib, for treatment, and the steroid was discontinued after two months. OUTCOMES: A Chest CT scan after one week of treatment showed progressive disappearance of lung lesions, and the patient was discharged on oral methylprednisolone (32\u00a0mg qd) for two weeks after which the dose was reduced gradually. CONCLUSION: OP should be considered when new lesions appear in the lungs of lung cancer patients, and distinguished from infectious pneumonia, metastasis, or cancer progression. In this respect, pathological biopsy plays an important role in diagnosis. In our case, discontinuation of ceritinib and regular steroid administration were effective.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ALK inhibitors for ALK fusion-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), drug resistance remains a challenge. Studies of treatment outcomes and resistance biomarkers are imperative for drug development, yet patient representation can be limited. This study evaluated the feasibility of a decentralized research infrastructure to establish a clinical and biospecimen repository, broadening patient access and inclusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC across the U.S. were enrolled through remote informed consent. Clinical history and tumor molecular profiling data were collected at baseline and during remote follow-ups. Archival tumor and saliva biospecimens (for germline sampling) were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: Of 87 eligible patients, 80 (92%) completed remote consent and enrolled. Clinical data collection rate was 100%, with archival tumor acquired from 80% and saliva samples from 65%. Patients represented 31 states, with 94% residing outside the study center's state and 90% receiving care elsewhere. Next-generation sequencing was conducted on 55 treatment-na\u00efve and 18 treatment-resistant biopsies, all of whom received at least one prior second-generation ALK inhibitor and nine received lorlatinib. ALK resistance mutations were identified in 54% of treatment-resistant biopsies; other commonly co-altered genes included TP53 (18%) and CDKN2A/B (16%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the feasibility of a decentralized design to enhance the inclusion of a broader patient population with ALK+ NSCLC. This establishes a scalable framework that may help overcome barriers to patient participation in research, with the goal of improving therapy development and patient outcomes. The ENIGMA+ study accrual and analysis continue (NCT04881916).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 3-7% of all cases and causes oncogene addiction. Although ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) are effective for treating ALK-positive NSCLC, some patients still show suboptimal responses and poor outcomes. Clinically simple and detectable biomarkers for this group are limited. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1 and CYFRA) are widely used tumor markers in NSCLC. Elevated CEA levels are linked to tumor progression and resistance to cell death, while CYFRA is widely expressed in poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. CYFRA has been identified as a prognostic factor in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive NSCLC, but its role in ALK-positive NSCLC remains unclear. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed the value of CEA and CYFRA as predictive biomarkers in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC treated with ALK-TKIs. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 197 patients with advanced or recurrent ALK-positive NSCLC, who were diagnosed across 13 institutions in Japan and received their first ALK-TKI between July 1, 2014 and December 31, 2022. Eligible patients had measurable lesions based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Patients were stratified based on normal (\u22645.0 and \u22643.5 ng/mL) or high (>5.0 and >3.5 ng/mL) baseline serum CEA and CYFRA levels. Serum CYFRA and CEA levels, which were measured using commercially available immunoassays per standard institutional protocols. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) with initial ALK-TKI therapy, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 152 patients with available CYFRA data, 91 (59.9%) had normal CYFRA levels and 61 (40.1%) had elevated levels. In this analysis, patients in the high CYFRA group had significantly shorter median PFS and OS (9.27 and 28.8 months, respectively) than those in the normal CYFRA group (42.0 and 143.3 months, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high CYFRA levels were independent predictors of poor PFS (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.50-3.68, P<0.001) and OS (HR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.89-5.70, P<0.001). Furthermore, the high CYFRA group had lower ORR and complete response (CR) rates, compared with the normal CYFRA group. In contrast, no significant differences in PFS or OS were observed between patients with normal and elevated CEA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CYFRA levels correlate with reduced PFS and OS in ALK-positive NSCLC, indicating potential as a prognostic biomarker. Given CYFRA's association with tumor heterogeneity, which reduces ALK-TKI efficacy, its assessment could aid in risk stratification and treatment planning. Additional research is needed to verify the predictive value of CYFRA for ALK-TKI efficacy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant anaplastic lymphoma kinase () rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an unmet need. Among these patients, the efficacy of immunotherapy has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with ALK-TKI-resistant NSCLC, stratified by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of advanced NSCLC patients with -rearrangement, who were treated with immunotherapy or chemotherapy after the development of ALK-TKI resistance at the Shanghai Chest Hospital. Progression-free survival (PFS) was used to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: The final analysis included 89 patients between June 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, who met the selection criteria. The entire cohort had a median follow-up time of 33.4 months. The patients who received immunotherapy had better PFS than those who received non-immunotherapy (median PFS: 5.3  2.5 months; P=0.009). The PD-L1-positive patients who received immunotherapy had a median PFS of 7.1 months, while those who received non-immunotherapy had a median PFS of 2.5 months (P=0.02). No such statistically significant difference was observed in the PD-L1-negative patients (median PFS for with immunotherapy  without immunotherapy: 1.5  2.9 months; P=0.68). The PD-L1-positive patients who underwent re-biopsy after the development of TKI resistance and who received immunotherapy had a PFS of 7.8 months, while those who received non-immunotherapy had a PFS of 2.7 months (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first real-world retrospective study to show that some patients with positive PD-L1 expression may benefit from immune-based therapy after the development of ALK-TKI resistance. However, we still recommend biopsy for patients who develop ALK-TKI resistance to provide further treatment guidance.",

      "title": "Targeted Protein Degradation in Lung Cancer: The Emerging Role of PROTAC Technology and E3 Ligases.",
      "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies, with poor drug response and high mortality rates. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy, leveraging E3 ligases to degrade oncogenic proteins selectively via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These degraders offer higher selectivity and bioavailability compared to traditional inhibitors. This review explores how PROTACs eliminate oncogenic proteins in lung cancer and examines the role of E3 ligases in this process. Commonly utilized ligases include Cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), while newer ones, such as MDM2 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), are being investigated for therapeutic potential. We discuss key factors in PROTAC design, including ligand selection, linker optimization, and pharmacokinetic properties, which influence tumor specificity and efficacy while minimizing off- target effects. Additionally, we highlight targetable oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, such as KRAS, EGFR, and ALK fusion proteins, and evaluate preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate PROTACs' potential for overcoming drug resistance. The challenges associated with clinical translation, tumor microenvironment interactions, and E3 ligase selection are also discussed. Finally, we present future perspectives, including expanding the range of E3 ligases, developing multitargeting strategies, and integrating next-generation molecular glue degraders. By offering a comparative analysis of E3 ligase- specific PROTACs, this review underscores the potential of PROTAC technology to advance precision oncology in lung cancer.",
