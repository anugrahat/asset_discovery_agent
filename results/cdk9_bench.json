      "title": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Novel Therapeutic Targets Under Investigation.",
      "abstract": "CLL is the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries, characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes. Over the past decade, the therapeutic landscape for CLL has undergone significant transformations, primarily due to the introduction of targeted small molecular therapies like BTK inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors, that have improved patient outcomes drastically. Despite significant advances, long-term disease management remains challenging for patients with double-refractory CLL, where responses with subsequent therapies are short-lived. Resistance to these therapies can arise through several mechanisms like kinase-altering BTK mutations, alterations in the BCL-2 pathway, and adaptations within the tumor microenvironment, necessitating the exploration of new therapeutic options. This review provides an in-depth overview of the promising novel treatment approaches under investigation in CLL, focusing on advanced cellular therapies (CAR T-cell therapy), T-cell engagers, new monoclonal antibodies, and various next-generation small molecule inhibitors including BTK degraders, PI3K inhibitors, MALT1 inhibitors, c-MYC inhibitors, CDK9 inhibitors, and agents targeting angiogenesis and DNA damage repair. In this review, we will discuss the novel therapeutic targets and agents as well as ongoing trials, emphasizing the potential of these treatments to overcome resistance and meet the unmet needs of patients, particularly those with double-refractory CLL.",

      "title": "Advances in KEAP1-based PROTACs as emerging therapeutic modalities: Structural basis and progress.",
      "abstract": "Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) functions as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin 3-RING E3 ligase complex, mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). This regulatory mechanism maintains cellular redox homeostasis by preventing NRF2 overactivation. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy that harnesses the ubiquitin-proteasome system for targeted protein degradation. Recent advancements have expanded the repertoire of E3 ligases exploitable for PROTAC design, with KEAP1 identified as a promising candidate. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural and functional characteristics of KEAP1, detailing its interactions with NRF2 and Cullin 3. The development of KEAP1- recruiting PROTACs utilizing ligands derived from different classes of known KEAP1 inhibitors-including short peptides, covalent small molecules (e.g., CDDO derivatives), and non-covalent inhibitors (e.g., KI696)-is discussed, highlighting the potential to diversify the available E3 ligase recruiters. Recent progress in developing KEAP1-based PROTACs targeting BRD4, CDK9, FAK, Tau and KEAP1 itself is highlighted, with particular emphasis on ligand optimization strategies employed to enhance degradation efficacy and specificity. Elucidating the structural basis of KEAP1 interactions provides crucial insights for advancing PROTAC applications. However, current challenges in KEAP1-based targeted protein degradation warrant further investigation to fully realize its therapeutic potential. Future research should focus on optimizing KEAP1 ligand properties and exploring novel protein targets amenable to degradation via KEAP1 recruitment to further advance this innovative therapeutic modality.",

RNA polymerases trapped in DNA can be a source of transcription-replication conflict (T-R conflict), which is a common source of replication stress.\u00a0AZD4573, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, has been shown to induce apoptosis in leukemia\u00a0cell lines, while its anti-tumor potential in breast cancer has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: To evaluate the cytotoxicity of AZD4573 in vitro, MTT assays were performed. The expression of signal transduction molecules was determined using Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. Apoptotic cell death was verified by the annexin-V assay. DNA strand breaks and repair efficacy were evaluated through the alkaline comet assay. The siRNA knock-down system was used to confirm the action mechanism. RESULTS: AZD4573 induced T-R conflicts during S-phase, increasing replication stress and DNA strand breaks, resulting in apoptosis by induction of caspase-3. Furthermore, we identified Dead-box 25 (DDX25) helicase as a key mediator in resolving the T-R conflicts. Nuclear translocation of DDX25 correlated with reduced sensitivity to AZD4573 by the resolution of T-R conflicts. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of CDK9 by AZD4573 induces the accumulation of DNA damage through T-R conflicts. DDX25 helicases were identified as a key mediator in resolving T-R conflicts and the reduced sensitivity to AZD4573.",

      "abstract": "People with human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis B virus (HIV-HBV) co-infection have faster rates of liver disease progression and an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma compared to people with HBV mono-infection. Given that HIV can infect multiple cells in the liver, including hepatocytes, we hypothesized that HIV will impact HBV replication through HIV viral proteins that can impact HBV replication either directly or indirectly, via effects on cellular pathways. Following infection of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP)-expressing HepG2 cells with HBV and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV.G)-pseudotyped HIV, we found that productive HIV infection led to a twofold upregulation of HBV surface (HBs) mRNA and a marked increase in intracellular production and cellular retention of HBs antigen (HBsAg). Overexpression of HIV Tat protein, but not other HIV proteins, by DNA plasmid transfection in the HBV-producing cell line AD38 significantly stimulated HBs mRNA expression. This could be rescued by CDK9 inhibition with BAY-1251152. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which HIV directly impacts HBV replication and has implications for understanding adverse liver outcomes in people living with HIV and HBV.IMPORTANCEPeople with both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) face faster liver disease progression and a higher risk of liver cancer than those with HBV alone. This study investigated how HIV affects HBV replication in liver cells and found that HIV infection increases the production of a key HBV surface protein (HBsAg) by enhancing the expression of its gene (HBs). This effect is driven by the HIV Tat protein. Notably, blocking the CDK9 pathway prevented this increase, suggesting a possible explanation for the adverse liver outcomes in co-infected individuals. Our findings have implications for interventions aiming to cure HIV through latency reversal, as these interventions can specifically increase the Tat protein. Future exploratory treatment strategies, such as Tat inhibitors, could play a role in the management of people with HIV and HBV at high risk of liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Non-genetic transcription evolution has been increasingly explored and recognized to drive tumor cell progression and therapeutic resistance. As the regulation hub of transcription machinery, cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is the gatekeeper of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, and CDK9 dysfunction results in transcriptomic reprogramming and tumor cell progression. We recently reported that the HSP90-MYC-CDK9 network drives therapeutic resistance in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) through transcriptomic reprogramming. We also showed that targeting CDK9 by AZD4573 and enitociclib is a safe and effective treatment in preclinical MCL models, supporting CDK9 as a valid therapeutic target for MCL. However, current CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i) under therapeutic development have room for improvement due to limited target selectivity and oral bioavailability. To this end, YX0798 was discovered to be a novel CDK9i through structural optimization. YX0798 demonstrated remarkable target selectivity and high affinity in binding to CDK9. Furthermore, YX0798 showed good oral bioavailability. YX0798, when administrated orally (5 mg/kg, daily), led to an efficacious anti-tumor activity in vivo and showed the potency in overcoming therapeutic resistance. Mechanistically, YX0798 downregulated the short-lived oncoprotein c-MYC and pro-survival protein MCL-1 as a common mechanism of CDK9 inhibition. Moreover, YX0798 disrupted the cell cycle and resulted in transcriptomic reprogramming, eventually leading to cell death. Furthermore, YX0798 has the potential to be used in combination therapy with clinical agents to improve treatment efficacy. Together, these data demonstrate that YX0798 has oral bioavailability, exquisite selectivity, and anti-tumor potency that results from driving transcription reprogramming towards tumor cell killing.",

      "abstract": "The twelfth multi-stakeholder Paediatric Strategy focused on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. Genetic aberrations in paediatric tumours increase CDK4/6 activity, thus the pathway is a therapeutic target. As a result, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials for children and young adults with different malignancies, both as single agents and in combination, including molecular enrichment in ESMART. In some instances, trials of different agents within this same class are very similar in design or target population, leading to duplication. Consistent with preclinical data with CDK4/6 inhibitors which mostly demonstrate cytostasis, but not tumour regression, objective responses are rare, although there may be slowing of tumour growth. Similar to adults, no predictive biomarkers have been identified and an integrated comprehensive clinical development strategy of this class of agents is lacking. Patient advocates believe that the many trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors, which have enrolled many children and young people, have not been matched by sufficient gains in knowledge. CDK9, CDK12 and CDK13 inhibitors, based on exploitation of transcriptional vulnerabilities, have shown promise in preclinical models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma and translocation fusion-driven malignancies. The development of these inhibitors should be sequential, iterative and coordinated, including early engagement with regulators. In conclusion, there needs to be prioritisation and coordination of any further development of CDK4/6 inhibitors in paediatric malignancies. Definite tumour regression in preclinical models, not just cytostasis, should be taken as the go/no go decision point to progress such agents to clinical studies. Based on limited single agent activity in preclinical models, trials of new inhibitors should avoid unnecessary exposure of patients to monotherapy and rapidly progress to combination strategies, while retaining designs that allow early evaluation of activity. A framework to support integrated development strategies of new products across sponsors would be very beneficial.",

Here, we report on the results of the phase 1 clinical trial of BTX A51 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and MDS. METHODS: Adult patients with R/R AML and high-risk MDS were enrolled into eight potential doses ranging from 1 to 42\u00a0mg dosed orally three days/week for 21 or 28\u00a0days out of a 28-day cycle. The maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BTX A51 were investigated. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were enrolled and received treatment with BTX A51. Median age was 75 (range 22- 84) and 55% were male. Most patients (97%) had received prior treatment with venetoclax and hypomethylating agents. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were nausea (67%), emesis (63%), hypokalemia (53%), and diarrhea (40%). Two patients experienced hepatic toxicity as DLTs, which resolved upon holding treatment. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The recommended phase 2 dose was 21\u00a0mg dosed three days/week for 4\u00a0weeks of a 28-day cycle. BTX A51 increased the expression of p53 and reduced the expression of MCL1 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation in pre- and post-treatment immunocytochemistry studies. Overall, 3 patients (10%) experienced complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi). All 3 responding patients had RUNX1 mutations and the CR/CRi rate for RUNX1-mutated patients receiving BTX A51 at efficacious doses (11\u00a0mg or higher) was 30%. Ex-vivo studies confirmed higher efficacy of BTX A51 on RUNX1-mutated myeloblasts and demonstrated synergy with azacitidine and venetoclax. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall efficacy was modest, this study lays the groundwork for future studies with improved patient selection and combination approaches. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04872166.",

      "abstract": "PROTAC technology presents promising options for treating various diseases, including cancer. Several PROTAC molecules are currently being tested in clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Despite this progress, challenges such as poor bioavailability, off-tumor and/or off-target toxicity, and instability in biological environments hinder their therapeutic potential. Enhancing the therapeutic index of PROTACs is crucial, and one promising approach is converting PROTACs into nanomedicines. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a key cell cycle regulator implicated in various cancers. THAL-SNS-032 (THAL), a CDK9 degrader PROTAC, has shown effectiveness in preclinical models, but its clinical translation is limited by on-target off-tumor toxicity. This study aimed to convert THAL into nanomedicines to improve its preclinical profile for breast cancer treatment. To do so, loaded lipid-based nanoparticle formulations (LBNPs) were designed, liposomal formulation (cLIP-THAL), free-cholesterol liposomal formulation (LIP-THAL), and solid-lipid nanoparticles (SLN-THAL). These formulations demonstrated high stability and controlled drug release of THAL, with cLIP-THAL showing the most promising results. Biological assessments on breast cancer cell lines indicated that the nanomedicines were as effective as the free PROTAC in reducing cell viability, with lower toxicity in non-transformed cells. Overall, incorporating THAL-SNS-032 into nanomedicines offers a comprehensive approach with potential benefits in dose optimization, safety, and targeted delivery. These findings support the further development of nanomedicine-based PROTAC therapies for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Ovarian cancer patients with homologous recombination (HR) proficiency are more likely to develop resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, resulting in poor prognosis. Harmine, a natural compound with verified clinical safety, is a potential inhibitor of HR activity. However, its effect on HR has not been tested in ovarian cancer. More importantly, its specific target involving the HR pathway is still unknown. A fluorescent reporter cell system was employed to assess the HR efficiency of cells treated by harmine. The target of harmine in the HR pathway was identified via a molecular docking screening in silico and confirmed using a cellular thermal shift assay. Evaluation of harmine treatment combined with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in BRCA1/2 wild-type ovarian cancer was performed. Treatment with harmine inhibited HR activity in a dose-dependent manner in ovarian cancer cells and selectively suppressed HR-proficient cells with high replication stress, marked with CCNE1 amplification. HR-related protein cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) was identified as the target of harmine. Specifically, harmine diminished the interaction of CDK9 with cyclin T, resulting in impaired formation of the p-TEFb complex and subsequent transcription elongation. Hence, harmine downregulated the transcription of key HR-related genes. Moreover, harmine synergized with PARP inhibitor olaparib in BRCA1/2 wild-type ovarian cancer.

      "title": "BRD4 acts as a transcriptional repressor of RhoB to inhibit terminal erythropoiesis.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Terminal erythropoiesis is a complex multistep process involving coordination of gene transcription and dramatic nuclear condensation, which leads to the expulsion of nuclei to generate reticulocytes. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the key transcriptional and epigenetic regulators involved. METHODS: We used a high-throughput small molecule screen in primary CD34-derived human erythroblasts to identify targets that promoted terminal erythropoiesis, and further confirmed the phenotype in different differentiation systems by inhibitors and shRNAs of different BRD4 isoforms. Then we performed RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-qPCR, Co-IP, and reanalyzed previously-published transcriptional data and mass spectrometric data to clarify how BRD4 regulates terminal erythropoiesis. RESULTS: We identified that inhibitors of the bromodomain protein BRD4, an epigenetic reader and transcriptional activator together with CDK9, promoted terminal erythropoiesis from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and embryonic stem cells, and enhanced enucleation. Combined analysis of our RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and previously-published transcriptional data of erythroblast differentiation at different stages confirmed that BRD4 inhibition accelerates erythroblast maturation. Unexpectedly, this BRD4 function was independent of its classical CDK9 interaction and transcriptional activation. Instead, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and Cut&Tag upon BRD4 inhibition revealed that BRD4 regulates erythropoiesis by inhibiting the small G protein RhoB and disrupts actin reorganization. ChIP-qPCR, Co-IP, and functional studies revealed that BRD4 acts as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the histone methyltransferase EHMT1/2. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a non-classical role for BRD4 as a transcriptional repressor of RhoB to regulate erythroid maturation, and classical CDK9 dependent role to regulate cell proliferation of erythroblasts. Besides, we clarify RhoB's activity and function during terminal erythropoiesis. BRD4 inhibition might be a simple method to promote in vitro blood cell production, and a candidate therapeutic target for diseases leading to dyserythropoiesis such as myelodysplastic syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Skin hyperplasia and aberrant secretion of inflammatory factors are typical features of psoriasis. Given the cooperative role of CDK6-mediated cell proliferation and CDK9-mediated disturbance of inflammatory cytokines in the progression of psoriasis, dual inhibition of CDK6 and CDK9 is expected to not only exert synergetic anti-psoriatic effects but also reduce the toxicity of single-target inhibition. In this study, on the basis of our previously discovered lead, a total of 17 final compounds were designed and synthesized for exploring additional hydrogen bond interactions with hydrophilic residues in the inner pocket of CDK6 or CDK9. Among them, 4, with dual CDK6 and CDK9 inhibitory activities, was capable to ameliorate inflammation in vitro. Furthermore, it inhibited the activation of STAT3 pathway and decreased the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors in IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1-induced HaCaT cells. These findings indicate dual CDK6 and CDK9 inhibitors may emerge as potential therapeutic agents for psoriasis.",

In this study, a library of 216 clinically feasible small-molecule inhibitors was screened to identify agents that selectively inhibit MM cell proliferation. Enitociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 9-specific small-molecule inhibitor, was found to be highly effective in decreasing cell viability and inducing apoptosis in 4 MM cell lines. Enitociclib inhibited the phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II at Ser2/Ser5 and repressed the protein expression of oncogenes c-Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in MM cells. Additionally, enitociclib demonstrated synergistic effects with several anti-MM agents, including bortezomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and venetoclax. These results suggest that enitociclib may represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of MM, either as a single agent or in combination with other anti-MM agents.",

In this work, starting from a multitargeted CDK1/2/9 inhibitor ZK304709, optimization efforts successfully led to the discovery of a highly potent selective CDK9 inhibitor 8e which exhibites significant enzyme inhibitory activity (IC\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u00a0nM) which is comparable to that of ZK304709 (IC\u00a0=\u00a05.0\u00a0nM). More importantly, 8e shows high selectivity for CDK9 versus CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, respectively. Additionally, 8e possesses greater or similar antiproliferative efficacy with ZK304709 against HeLa, A549, HCT116, and MCF-7\u00a0cells, and exhibits potent in vivo antitumor activity in HCT116 xenograft mouse models with tumor growth inhibition of 59.2\u00a0% at 60\u00a0mg/kg without obvious signs of toxicity. Research on the mechanism reveals that 8e could concentration-dependently cause the G/M phase arrest and induce cell apoptosis in HCT116\u00a0cells. These observations provide a novel tetrahydrothiazolopyridine-based pyrimidine scaffold to further develop selective CDK9 inhibitors for cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The emergence of drug resistance poses a serious threat to cancer chemotherapy by a single agent. Tumor cell heterogeneity, mutation, and/or desensitization of receptor render monotherapy ineffective. Combination encompassing multiple targets or biochemical pathways seems promising for cancer treatment. Combination of HDAC inhibitor(s) with other inhibitor(s) has shown synergistic activity in cancer chemotherapy by modulating a variety of therapeutic targets including epigenetic target of cancer cells by restoring acetylation and reactivating tumor suppressor genes leading to cell cycle arrest, promoting apoptosis, and thus inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive published patent literature (2020-present) on rational combinations of HDAC inhibitor(s) for cancer chemotherapy has been retrieved and reviewed from various patent databases including Google Patents, Espacenet, Patentscope, WIPO, and USPTO to analyze the rational combinations for better, optimized, and precise cancer therapy. In this second part of two-part review, we highlighted the patent published for the combination. EXPERT OPINION: The HDAC inhibitor(s) in combination with other therapeutically relevant inhibitor(s) such as MAPK, GSK3, PI3K/mTOR, PARP, CDK9, HSP90, BTK, BRD4, JAK, VEGF, ALK, PD-1, or PDE inhibitor showed synergistic anti-cancer activity. These combinations not only overcame drug resistance but also acted against relapsed/refractory cancers.",

      "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying transcriptional dysregulation in tumorigenesis have received considerable attention as promising therapeutic targets to combat human cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are significant therapeutic targets due to their pivotal roles in the dysregulated transcriptional programs characteristic of many cancers. Furthermore, the combinatorial transcriptional therapy with CDK9 and class I HDAC inhibitors has been shown to have a synergistic anticancer effect. In this study, a series of novel N-(2-amino-phenyl)-5-(4-aryl-pyrimidin-2-yl) amino)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide derivatives were designed and synthesized as novel dual-functional inhibitors targeting CDK9 and HDAC signaling pathways for cancer treatment. Among the synthesized compounds, 13ea demonstrated potent anti-proliferative activities (IC\u00a0<\u00a05.0\u00a0\u03bcM) in various cancer cell lines (HeLa, MDA-MB-231, HepG2). In addition, 13ea was found to significantly inhibit the phosphorylation function of CDK9 and the deacetylation function of class I HDACs. Furthermore, 13ea was found to inhibit the protein activity of CDK9 (IC\u00a0=\u00a00.17\u00a0\u03bcM), HDAC1 (IC\u00a0=\u00a01.73\u00a0\u03bcM), and HDAC3 (IC\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u00a0\u03bcM). The docking studies predicted the binding patterns of 13ea in the active pockets of CDK9 and HDAC1/3. The cellular assays revealed that 13ea induced mitochondria-related apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in cancer cells, showing superior activities compared to those of AZD-5438 (a CDK9 inhibitor) and Mocetinostat (an inhibitor of class I HDACs). Notably, the in vivo assay demonstrated that 13ea (30\u00a0mg/kg) exhibited significant inhibition on MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth, with a tumor shrinkage rate of 76.83\u00a0%. In summary, we have identified 13ea as a novel CDK9/HDAC inhibitor with excellent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo.",
