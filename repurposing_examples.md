# Real Drug Repurposing Success Stories

## 1. Sildenafil (Viagra)
- **Originally developed for**: Angina (heart chest pain)
- **Failed because**: Not effective enough for angina
- **Repurposed for**: Erectile dysfunction
- **Why it worked**: Side effect became the main benefit
- **Now also used for**: Pulmonary hypertension

## 2. Thalidomide
- **Originally**: Morning sickness drug (withdrawn due to birth defects)
- **Repurposed for**: Multiple myeloma (blood cancer)
- **Why it works**: Anti-angiogenic properties kill cancer
- **Strict controls**: Only for specific cancers with pregnancy prevention

## 3. Metformin
- **Originally**: Type 2 diabetes
- **Being repurposed for**: Cancer prevention, anti-aging
- **Why**: Reduces cancer risk, affects longevity pathways

## 4. Remdesivir
- **Originally developed for**: Ebola
- **Failed**: Not effective enough against Ebola
- **Repurposed for**: COVID-19
- **Why it worked**: Effective against SARS-CoV-2 virus

## How Our AI Agent Helps:

1. **Analyzes WHY drugs failed**:
   - Toxicity at required dose?
   - Wrong target?
   - Wrong patient population?

2. **Identifies NEW opportunities**:
   - Different diseases where the drug might work
   - Lower doses for different indications
   - Combination therapies

3. **Suggests ALTERNATIVE targets**:
   - If EGFR inhibitors failed for glioblastoma
   - Maybe try PD-1, VEGF, or IDH1 instead
   - Based on understanding WHY EGFR failed

## The Value:
- **Saves 10+ years** of development time
- **Saves $1+ billion** in development costs
- **Known safety profile** from previous trials
- **Faster path to patients** who need treatment
